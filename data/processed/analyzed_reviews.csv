Legends of Pegasus,Novacore Studios,Kalypso,User,,"I'm unsure what happened with LoP. While in development, the game seemed to have decent support. Then, suddenly, Summer of 2012,  It was released in a less-than-playable state with non-existent support. Complaints from people who had paid for the game in good faith were everywhere. Players were discussing how to approach getting their money refunded. In October of 2012 the developers filed for Bankruptcy. I haven't seen a really decent explanation of why LoP was released before it was ready although many claim that's how Kalypso does business. Others say publishers are pushing developers into premature release of their games. Some sites were still taking orders for LoP at the time that Novacore announced its insolvency which is, IMHO, inexcusable. The only reason why some people were spared is bc players posted warnings not to buy the game.   More than a few people reported that they were denied refunds due to game time logged even though they were not able to actually play the game. This calls into question the ethics of charging players for games not yet published. Aren't beta players really assisting developers in identifying problems needing to be solved? Shouldn't there be some kind of reward offered to the people who play pre-release games? How fair is it to charge people who participate in beta testing the full price for the game when they are the ones assuming the risk that the game might flop?","['unsure', 'happened', 'lop', 'development', 'game', 'seemed', 'decent', 'support', 'suddenly', 'summer', 'released', 'state', 'support', 'complaint', 'people', 'paid', 'game', 'good', 'faith', 'everywhere', 'player', 'discussing', 'approach', 'getting', 'money', 'refunded', 'october', 'developer', 'filed', 'bankruptcy', 'seen', 'really', 'decent', 'explanation', 'lop', 'released', 'ready', 'although', 'many', 'claim', 'kalypso', 'business', 'others', 'say', 'publisher', 'pushing', 'developer', 'premature', 'release', 'game', 'site', 'still', 'taking', 'order', 'lop', 'time', 'novacore', 'announced', 'insolvency', 'imho', 'inexcusable', 'reason', 'people', 'spared', 'bc', 'player', 'posted', 'warning', 'buy', 'game', 'people', 'reported', 'denied', 'refund', 'due', 'game', 'time', 'logged', 'even', 'though', 'able', 'actually', 'play', 'game', 'call', 'question', 'ethic', 'charging', 'player', 'game', 'yet', 'published', 'beta', 'player', 'really', 'assisting', 'developer', 'identifying', 'problem', 'needing', 'solved', 'kind', 'reward', 'offered', 'people', 'play', 'game', 'fair', 'charge', 'people', 'participate', 'beta', 'testing', 'full', 'price', 'game', 'one', 'assuming', 'risk', 'game', 'might', 'flop']",unsure happened lop development game seemed decent support suddenly summer released state support complaint people paid game good faith everywhere player discussing approach getting money refunded october developer filed bankruptcy seen really decent explanation lop released ready although many claim kalypso business others say publisher pushing developer premature release game site still taking order lop time novacore announced insolvency imho inexcusable reason people spared bc player posted warning buy game people reported denied refund due game time logged even though able actually play game call question ethic charging player game yet published beta player really assisting developer identifying problem needing solved kind reward offered people play game fair charge people participate beta testing full price game one assuming risk game might flop,,0.7138,Positive,,0.4019,-0.296,-0.296,0.3612,0.3612,0.02619166666666667,,,0.0,,-0.296

Majestic, agile and ruthless creatures that populate mini areas scattered here and there around the world.There are no 'simple' enemies, only checkpoints in strategic positions, in order to make recovery after game over simple and many bosses to face.Once you enter the arena the battle begins and there are only two ways to get out: alive, hitting the monster's weak point, or dead, the more probable **** hit is enough to trigger the game over but the same goes for the opponent we will face, with the only obligation that we should hit him in his 'hidden' weak point with the only arrow present in our hero's quiver. That's right, just an arrow which, however, can be thrown and retrieved infinitely either by walking on it or by recalling it with telekinetic powers, taking into account that without a weapon we are effectively harmless and at the mercy of the monster. In a nutshell, the clash with a new creature is divided into two phases: the first of gathering information and modus operandi of the giant in question and the second of implementing the attack plan, carefully designed in one's head, to get the upper hand . Many attempts separate the player from victory, especially with the last ruthless giants, but the goal to be achieved is never too far away, and the satisfaction of seeing the David within us defeat the Goliath of the moment, will manage to tear more than a smile from lips of those who will be able to seize the best moment to strike.David Fenn's first musical works already show the talent and skill of the English singer-songwriter which years later will lead him to create one of my favorite soundtracks, that of Death's door!The staging in this title is obviously still immature, a sort of embryonic version of what will later become a very respectable soundtrack in the subsequent work. But despite this, he does his accompanying work damn well and more than one track will have the ability to carve out a space in the hearts of fans. This is for two reasons: one unconscious, as by repeating a clash infinite times and then listening to the notes continuously the player will end up loving (or hating) the tracks and the other because some music will have the ability to give us a boost in times of need to win the battle.Acid Nerve's inspiration from Fumito Ueda's game Shadow of the Colossus released 10 years earlier is great; a character in a lonely world who must defeat creatures who are even difficult to approach. Of course, the differences on a technical, graphic, setting and duration level bring the two titles to different levels of the global video game scale. The work of Team Ico has entered history and the hearts of fans, something that the first work of the English team will never be able to do. Despite this, I consider the Indie 'game' an experience, which however short, deserves to be lived. Of course it is not a title for those who get discouraged at the first difficulty but only for those, like me, who get excited in the most challenging moments. Let's be clear, nothing is impossible, we just need to get carried away and savor with calm, perseverance and attentive eyes the right moment to launch the arrow into the Titan's 'Achilles' heel'.","['god', 'creates', 'titansgod', 'creates', 'manthe', 'destroy', 'godman', 'creates', 'bow', 'arrowthe', 'destroy', 'manthe', 'chosen', 'one', 'destroy', 'joystick', 'promised', 'would',

This is one of the kind. When I think of this DLC I think of it as one of the best DLCs of all time.

This DLC is like a sequel - with everything! Its WAST gorgeous map with highly enjoyable exploration.  There are several 'bioms' with different theme and feeling to it. Music and ambience of the places is magical. Bosses and chunkier enemies are fun. There are several NPCs with questlines which are comparably good with the main game. The price could feel a bit much for a DLC, but I sunk 80hours to my first playthrough and I would say that games for that price tag giving you usually less. And you couldn t say this DLC is just some appendix, it is full-fledged story expansion.

My only gripe for console players is that you need to have save saved or be good at speedrunning for reaching the point when you can enter the DLC... I would be glad that FromSoft be in the future more generous with choices for subsequent playthroughs like (yes, you can rant how ridiculous was the state of the game after launch, but they do quite a job on it and the game is quite a looker and runs smoothly) Lord of the Fallen or Lies of P (in the terms of mix and match the equipment possibilities) - you could unlock something during first plathrough and have it ticked somewhere if you choose to for next playthrough. These games are massive and I understand there is a picky community and splendid no-hit-runners and all, but that is not all. Some quality of life things would not dismantle the difficulty or anything, just to have more fun with more weapons and theirs unique move sets.

Orion: Dino Horde,Spiral Game Studios,Spiral Game Studios,User,5.0,"It's no Turok.
I'mma admit right off the bat that I actually had fun playing this. Perhaps more than I should have. But I get told that a lot. Apparently you're only meant to have a 'little bit of fun' over-waxing the floor at a shopping centre. Normal people falling is fun, but when the kid on crutches does the exact same thing - no more fun. I learn things everyday.
For example, today when I was looking for this game on Metacritic I learned that it's had several name changes for no good reason. I looked for the game I played titled ORION: Prelude, but couldn't find it until I realised it used to be called ORION: Dino Horde. And that in itself was a rebrand from ORION: Dino Beatdown. You know that guy in 'The Good Place' that went to hell for being too indecisive? Well, Spiral Game Studios is where he got his training. I can only imagine what ORION: New Circle of Hell they're in for when they die.
So this game released to raving negative reviews. It was more broken than that crutches kid after having a personal introduction to that floor. And while several bugs remain to this day, for the most part this game has since been made a stable experience. Just don't play the Summit map. You shouldn't be playing that anyway. Without the bugs that's still just the worst map. You could say that Summit really peaked in annoying game design.
i'll see myself out now...
But yeah, other than Summit turning the skybox and half the models completely black, meaning good luck seeing all those pterodactyls soaring around in the endless void, the game is truly playable. Now I don't wanna excuse a dev team for releasing and selling a broken product only to fix it later because, as we now know, this would become an anti-consumer standard practice in the industry. However, I'll let this slide as it was their first game and they seemed to improve this attitude for their next release before disappearing forever. Yea, it's just hard to be mad at something that doesn't exist. Although my girlfriend would disagree with that statement after I cheated on her with my co-worker. I'm an internet funny man. I don't have a co-worker. But hey, the realm of physicality won't stop me from having an imaginary ORION: Post-Lube Inspection. Apparently.
Anyway, video game. I only played the survival mode during my time with this game. There are less-than-a-few players still hopping around these servers. That's a real shame, because those strange times when another person from somewhere in the world did decide to load up this strange game 9 years after release and found my lobby were the best times. There are bots that try to help if no one else joins your game. I specifically say 'try to help' because their only use was as ORION: Dino Bait. They won't repair the generator you're defending, they won't use anything other than the basic rifle, and only rarely will they feel the need to pick you up after you've been downed. No, mostly their job description suggests they should run around erratically like a headless chicken until dinos show up and then they plant their feet firmly and take on the horde with their face. They kill a good deal of them before they die though. That's sweet of them.
This makes a great deal of otherwise optional things an absolute necessity because you are now fulfilling the roles of 5 team members, regardless of which class you pick. Trying to repair the generator will set all the big boss dinos on you immediately, like they're offended by the sounds engineers make. So you won't have a chance to get it back up before the knockback sends you to another map. Unless it's the T-Rex which either chomps you, or if you have the no-chomp upgrade, simply lodges you inside its model where you cannot leave as it slowly nibbles on the salty snack that was your face.
So with all these problems, why did I say I had fun? 2 reasons mostly.
Reason number A: I love most of the environments. It's not the most graphically appealing game, or the one with the most detailed worlds. Yet, most of the maps really do look pretty. I'm a **** for open spaces and over-saturated colours in everything, and this game REALLY scratches that itch. I also love the look of the jagged and interestingly structured mountains.
Reason number II: Play the assault class and buy the TREK bow. I had so much dumb fun jetpacking around popping off arrows at dinos and watching them fall like Hawkeye in Avengers, except I actually achieve something.  Then there's the alternative arrows. If you do manage to get a player in your game do a favour for me, would ya? When they're in a vehicle and least expect it, fly to the top of a mountain a knock out their car with an EMP arrow. The arrows are too small to see and you are way out of sight so they'll never know what happened. And that makes me happy.
So I did have a lot of dumb fun playing this game. I can't recommend it as a brilliant product, but I can tell you to just do it anyway

Objectively speaking, this game is meh, it's a bit of dumb fun with friends that can keep you occupied for maybe 1-2 hours. However, given it's price and how easy it is to play. It's worth a couple of bucks, especially if it's on sale. Make no mistake, this game is not amazing, it's not good. It's passable, but it's so much fun!

However it's not fully fleshed out and a little repetitive, but to it's credit, it was once a lot worse and the developers did listen to community feedback....until they made their next game.

Time waster
Fun
Cheap

Batman: Arkham City,Rocksteady Studios,Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment,User,9.0,"Graphics – 9/10Arkham City builds on its predecessor with an even more striking visual presentation. The UI remains clean, readable, and stylistically consistent, making health, XP, and gadget management **** environment is a massive highlightthe open city feels alive, grimy, and deeply immersive, filled with small details that reward exploration and reinforce the world’s oppressive atmosphere.Character models are excellent across the board. Joker, Two-Face, and Bane look iconic and refined, capturing the perfect blend of comic-book exaggeration and gritty realism.Animation quality is top-tier in combat and traversalsmooth, fluid, and empowering, making every punch, glide, and takedown feel like an authentic Batman moment. The only weak point lies in dialogue animations, where character movements don’t always match the tone of their speech.Still, visually, Arkham City shines.Audio – 8/10The music supports the atmosphere well, even if few tracks stand out as truly memorable.Sound effects are crisp and satisfyingcombat hits sound impactful, and gadget use feels appropriately mechanical and weighty.Voice acting remains a major strength of the series. Batman and Joker’s performances are excellent, adding emotional weight and personality to every scene.Gameplay – 8/10Controls can feel a bit clunky at times, which is understandable given the expanded set of gadgets and traversal options.Combat remains the game’s most creative and refined system, with smooth chaining, expressive combos, and satisfying takedowns that make every encounter **** game is simply fun to play, especially with the shift to an open city. The added sidequests and activities make the world feel busy, dangerous, and alive.Gadgets enhance both combat and puzzle-solving, offering a strong sense of progression as new tools unlock and expand Batman’s capabilities.Story – 9/10Arkham City delivers a compelling narrative supported by strong dialogue and excellent line delivery from the voice cast.Environmental storytelling, however, is where the game truly excels. Posters, props, hidden details, and environmental clues work together to paint a rich picture of Gotham’s darkest district, adding depth without overwhelming the player.Overall Arkham City takes everything great about Arkham Asylum and expands it into a richer, more complex world. With superb visuals, powerful voice acting, refined combat, and an atmospheric open city, it remains one of the best superhero games ever made. Minor control issues and weak dialogue animations hold it back slightly, but not enough to dull its impact.Final Score: 9/10","['graphic', 'build', 'predecessor', 'even', 'striking', 'visual', 'presentation', 'ui', 'remains', 'clean', 'readable', 'stylistically', 'consistent', 'making', 'health', 'xp', 'gadget', 'management', 'environment', 'massive', 'highlightthe', 'open', 'feel', 'alive', 'grimy', 'deeply', 'immersive', 'filled', 'small', 'detail', 'reward', 'exploration', 'reinforce', 'world', 'oppressive', 'model', 'excellent', 'across', 'board', 'joker', 'bane', 'look', 'iconic', 'refined', 'capturing', 'perfect', 'blend', 'exaggeration', 'gritty', 'quality', 'combat', 'traversalsmooth', 'fluid', 'empowering', 'making', 'every', 'punch', 'glide', 'takedown', 'feel', 'like', 'authentic', 'moment', 'weak', 'point', 'lie', 'dialogue', 'animation', 'character', 'movement', 'always', 'match', 'tone', 'visually', 'music', 'support', 'atmosphere', 'well', 'even', 'track', 'stand', 'truly', 'effect', 'crisp', 'satisfyingcombat', 'hit', 'sound', 'impactful', 'gadget', 'use', 'feel', 'appropriately', 'mechanical', 'acting', 'remains', 'major', 'strength', 'series', 'joker', 'performance', 'excellent', 'adding', 'emotional', 'weight', 'personality', 'every', 'feel', 'bit', 'clunky', 'time', 'understandable', 'given', 'expanded', 'set', 'gadget', 'traversal', 'remains', 'game', 'creative', 'refined', 'system', 'smooth', 'chaining', 'expressive', 'combo', 'satisfying', 'takedown', 'make', 'every', 'encounter', 'game', 'simply', 'fun', 'play', 'especially', 'shift', 'open', 'added', 'sidequests', 'activity', 'make', 'world', 'feel', 'busy', 'dangerous', 'enhance', 'combat', 'offering', 'strong', 'sense', 'progression', 'new', 'tool', 'unlock', 'expand', 'delivers', 'compelling', 'narrative', 'supported', 'strong', 'dialogue', 'excellent', 'line', 'delivery', 'voice', 'storytelling', 'however', 'game', 'truly', 'excels', 'poster', 'prop', 'hidden', 'detail', 'environmental', 'clue', 'work', 'together', 'paint', 'rich', 'picture', 'gotham', 'darkest', 'district', 'adding', 'depth', 'without', 'overwhelming', 'take', 'everything', 'great', 'asylum', 'expands', 'richer', 'complex', 'world', 'superb', 'visuals', 'powerful', 'voice', 'acting', 'refined', 'combat', 'atmospheric', 'open', 'remains', 'one', 'best', 'superhero', 'game', 'ever', 'made', 'minor', 'control', 'issue', 'weak', 'dialogue', 'animation', 'hold', 'back', 'slightly', 'enough', 'dull', 'score']",graphic build predecessor even striking visual presentation ui remains clean readable stylistically consistent making health xp gadget management environment massive highlightthe open feel alive grimy deeply immersive filled small detail reward exploration reinforce world oppressive model excellent across board joker bane look iconic refined capturing perfect blend exaggeration gritty quality combat traversalsmooth fluid empowering making every punch glide takedown feel like authentic moment weak point lie dialogue animation character movement always match tone visually music support atmosphere well even track stand truly effect crisp satisfyingcombat hit sound impactful gadget use feel appropriately mechanical acting remains major strength series joker performance excellent adding emotional weight personality every feel bit clunky time understandable given expanded set gadget traversal remains game creative refined system smooth chaining expressive combo satisfying takedown make every encounter game simply fun play especially shift open added sidequests activity make world feel busy dangerous enhance combat offering strong sense progression new tool unlock expand delivers compelling narrative supported strong dialogue excellent line delivery voice storytelling however game truly excels poster prop hidden detail environmental clue work together paint rich picture gotham darkest district adding depth without overwhelming take everything great asylum expands richer complex world superb visuals powerful voice acting refined combat atmospheric open remains one best superhero game ever made minor control issue weak dialogue animation hold back slightly enough dull score,9.0,0.9903,Positive,0.6021666666666666,0.6856555555555555,0.655125,0.7484166666666666,0.7262714285714286,0.637275,0.8479714285714286,0.9299,0.652575,0.93385,,

I highly recommend quickly playing through some games within the first 2 hours so you can get a refund if you don’t enjoy it like I didn’t.I was really shocked by how horrible my experience was... I had heard so many positive reviews on YouTube, and I’ve never been so let down by my expectations. 

This title is so overhyped, and it’s just sad. The controls in every game are clunky, imprecise, and irritating. Enemy AI is way too high, making the games very hard and almost impossible to feel anything besides frustration and anger. There are some good ideas, but every one of them is ruined by shallow gameplay and pointless difficulty.

It also seems a bit more complicated than civ as there are more resources and many many building types to shuffle, but this could very well be because Im a noob.

Ara: History Untold,Oxide Games,Xbox Game Studios,User,9.0,"This was my first time playing a 4X turn-based game, and what a great introduction to the genre! 

Of course, this game may not appeal to every type of player due to the amount of micromanagement it requires. The graphics are decent, the sound effects are cool, and most importantly, the gameplay is satisfying in itself. 

There are a few things that need to be improved. The good news is that the game is still receiving updates and DLCs. Therefore, we can expect improvements to its UI, core mechanics, and the addition of new content, such as new maps, nation leaders, and more.

You will need patiencethis is not a 40-minute match kind of game. Build strategically, grow steadily, conquer fiercely.

Ara: History Untold,Oxide Games,Xbox Game Studios,User,4.0,"4/10 because of the mid-to-end game mechanics. I wonder how this game got approved at Xbox. They didn't play it. Eventually, you reach the city cap in the early game. You cannot do much about it. There's no reason to conquer, to expand, to build, or to wage war anymore because you've reached the city cap already. Your 'empire' then stalls around the early Middle Ages. From there, you'll skip all turns until the end of the game. Also, the AI nations change their attitude for no reason, but once you are strong and advanced, you simply sign trade and/or research agreements -- and they do not matter anymore.

GRIP: Combat Racing,Caged Element Inc.,Wired Productions,User,5.0,"If you like futuristic racing games I understand that there isn't a lot of competition about, but grip is not a 9 or 10/10.

If you are expecting anything like wipeout then you will be very disappointed. The sense of speed isn't as good, the vehicle and track design isn't as good and the weapons are not as good. A much better comparison would be one of the 3D sonic games - Grip reminds me much more of the fast sections in Sonic Heroes than anything else.

The weapons all seem to take ages to fire, I would guess about a second after pressing fire which is definitely not the case with the old futuristic racing games. The gravity-defying seems to amount to the physics not making a lot of sense and hitting a divot in the track can launch you into the sky and off the map straight into last place, even though the vehicles are supposed to have so much downforce they can drive up walls and ceilings?

The tracks are all rainbow road style affairs and frequently you will have no idea which way to even go in - like the worst parts of the twisted metal race events - and go straight to last place until you cruise around the track a couple of times at snails pace to find where to go.

I’m with their emergency services ground team and I help train cadets with our cadet program (think JROTC for ages 12-21).  I would not suggest his game for just anyone, but for those who have a desire to go into emergency medicine I can’t suggest it enough.  It is VERY realistic.  The triage, the procedures and equipment.  Even the medication is often exactly the right protocol.  I’ve had cadets who hare gamers, who also wish to become medics and I often suggest this game.  Basically this is to medics what a good flight simulator is to pilots.  Now, if you have no interest in medicine, you’ll probably hate it.

Bad Mojo,Pulse Entertainment,Pulse Entertainment,User,9.0,"Bad Mojo was amazing. I had heard about it many years ago but I recently remembered of it after seeing it mentioned in a list of good old games. The video cutscenes are silly (and very low quality) but they are funny but the gameplay is impeccable. It surprised me that while it was traditionally harder than newer games, it wasn’t that bad and I think the balance of its difficulty even for 2019 was excellent. It did not hand hold you and a puzzle or two could have better controls to make more sense, but it always gave hints. Only minor gripe I have with it is that the symbol that denotes there’s a guide nearby could be more explicitly explained at the start as an existence in the game because resolution was too low to notice it at the start.

Anyway, 9/10. It could easily be remade or turn HD.

9 Years of Shadows,Halberd Studios,Freedom Games,User,4.0,"I wanted so much to like this game. The art is beautiful. Game feel is great. Movement is typically pretty fast and responsive. But the more I played it. The more I just wanted it to be done.

It wants to be a metroidvania, but it just didn't quite meet the mark. Exploration is pretty fun but make sure you find everything the first time around, because looking for any missed upgrades is absolute agony.

On top of that, boss fights are frequent and uninspired. Out of the huge amount of bosses given the relatively small size of this game, I only actually enjoyed fighting 3 or 4 of them. Europa's moves etc is not nearly varied enough to keep things interesting for long. All of that is on top of the incredibly frustrating healing mechanic, and you're in for a bad time.

The last nail in the coffin is poor performance issues. It's pretty obvious certain parts of this game were not optimized. Near the end of the game, a certain boss fight becomes so choppy that it felt basically unplayable. 

I wanted to like this game, I really did. But all 9 Years of Shadows did was leave a bad taste in my mouth and the feeling that I wasted my money in the end. 

If your looking for a decent metroidvania, look elsewhere. 9 Years of Shadows certainly isn't one of them.","['wanted', 'much', 'like', 'game', 'art', 'beautiful', 'game', 'feel', 'great', 'movement', 'typically', 'pretty', 'fast', 'responsive', 'played', 'wanted', 'done', 'want', 'metroidvania', 'quite', 'meet', 'mark', 'exploration', 'pretty', 'fun', 'make', 'sure', 'find', 'everything', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'looking', 'missed', 'upgrade', 'absolute', 'agony', 'top', 'bos', 'fight', 'frequent', 'uninspired', 'huge', 'amount', 'boss', 'given', 'relatively', 'small', 'size', 'game', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'fighting', 'europa', 'move', 'etc', 'nearly', 'varied', 'enough', 'keep', 'thing', 'interesting', 'long', 'top', 'incredibly', 'frustrating', 'healing', 'mechanic', 'bad', 'time', 'last', 'nail', 'coffin', 'poor', 'performance', 'issue', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'certain', 'part', 'game', 'optimized', 'near', 'end', 'game', 'certain', 'bos', 'fight', 'becomes', 'choppy', 'felt', 'basically', 'unplayable', 'wanted', 'like', 'game', 'really', 'leave', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'feeling', 'wasted', 'money', 'end', 'looking', 'decent', 'metroidvania', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'certainly', 'one']",wanted much like game art beautiful game feel great movement typically pretty fast responsive played wanted done want metroidvania quite meet mark exploration pretty fun make sure find everything first time around looking missed upgrade absolute agony top bos fight frequent uninspired huge amount boss given relatively small size game actually enjoyed fighting europa move etc nearly varied enough keep thing interesting long top incredibly frustrating healing mechanic bad time last nail coffin poor performance issue pretty obvious certain part game optimized near end game certain bos fight becomes choppy felt basically unplayable wanted like game really leave bad taste mouth feeling wasted money end looking decent metroidvania look elsewhere certainly one,4.0,0.7474,Positive,,,0.058750000000000004,,0.04026666666666667,0.5423,-0.050780000000000006,-0.1593,0.0,0.25,,

Galactic Civilizations II: Twilight of the Arnor,Stardock,Stardock,User,9.0,"This game has some of the best A.I. you will ever find in a turn based strategy, which is a good thing since there is no multiplayer feature.  Unfortunately I feel the need to point out that if you're a fanatic TBS player like myself, it still holds no challenge (unless you let it cheat) once you figure the ins and outs of the game.  The music is average, the graphics are excellent, and the gameplay is utterly fantastic.

Galactic Civilizations 2's ship editor is one of the most impressive I have ever seen.  No need to take my word for it, just use google and look at what other people have made using it.

The planet micro management portion is quite interesting, with each planet having a chance to have certain tiles that give a  bonus to production/research/etc that makes each and every planet worth colonizing in the long run.  That crappy 4-5 quality planet that you'd normally ignore in search of something better?  It might just have a 800 production tile that makes it outstrip every other planet in the sector when it comes to building your war fleets.

Speaking of war, that's the one part of the game that keeps me from giving galactic civilizations 2 a 10 out of 10.  When it comes to combat, it really is a matter of rock/paper/scissors in terms of defense and offense.  You have lasers, missiles, guns and a corresponding defense for each.  All combat boils down to is who has more weapon 'points' that isn't covered by their enemy's defense points, and how many ships you have.  It doesn't get more complicated than that, which is a real shame.  One need only look at games like Master of Orion 2 to see how it could have been done better.  A turn based combat system that actually let you control the ships would have opened up entirely new avenues of fun and possibility.

All in all, a great game with almost no bugs (I have been playing it for well over a year and the only issue I ever encountered was a strange bug where I loaded a save and all ships had 1hp and 1 movement) that could have used minor tweaking in a few areas to truly be the game of the year instead of just great.","['game', 'best', 'ever', 'find', 'turn', 'based', 'strategy', 'good', 'thing', 'since', 'multiplayer', 'feature', 'unfortunately', 'feel', 'need', 'point', 'fanatic', 'tb', 'player', 'like', 'still', 'hold', 'challenge', 'unless', 'let', 'cheat', 'figure', 'game', 'music', 'average', 'graphic', 'excellent', 'gameplay', 'utterly', 'fantastic', 'ship', 'editor', 'one', 'impressive', 'ever', 'seen', 'need', 'take', 'word', 'use', 'google', 'look', 'people', 'made', 'using', 'planet', 'micro', 'management', 'portion', 'quite', 'interesting', 'planet', 'chance', 'certain', 'tile', 'give', 'bonus', 'make', 'every', 'planet', 'worth', 'colonizing', 'long', 'run', 'crappy', 'quality', 'planet', 'normally', 'ignore', 'search', 'something', 'better', 'might', 'production', 'tile', 'make', 'outstrip', 'every', 'planet', 'sector', 'come', 'building', 'war', 'fleet', 'speaking', 'war', 'one', 'part', 'game', 'keep', 'giving', 'come', 'combat', 'really', 'matter', 'term', 'defense', 'offense', 'laser', 'missile', 'gun', 'corresponding', 'defense', 'combat', 'boil', 'weapon', 'covered', 'enemy', 'defense', 'point', 'many', 'ship', 'get', 'complicated', 'real', 'shame', 'one', 'need', 'look', 'game', 'like', 'master', 'orion', 'see', 'could', 'done', 'better', 'turn', 'based', 'combat', 'system', 'actually', 'let', 'control', 'ship', 'would', 'opened', 'entirely', 'new', 'avenue', 'fun', 'possibility', 'great', 'game', 'almost', 'bug', 'playing', 'well', 'year', 'issue', 'ever', 'encountered', 'strange', 'bug', 'loaded', 'save', 'ship', 'movement', 'could', 'used', 'minor', 'tweaking', 'area', 'truly', 'game', 'year', 'instead', 'great']",game best ever find turn based strategy good thing since multiplayer feature unfortunately feel need point fanatic tb player like still hold challenge unless let cheat figure game music average graphic excellent gameplay utterly fantastic ship editor one impressive ever seen need take word use google look people made using planet micro management portion quite interesting planet chance certain tile give bonus make every planet worth colonizing long run crappy quality planet normally ignore search something better might production tile make outstrip every planet sector come building war fleet speaking war one part game keep giving come combat really matter term defense offense laser missile gun corresponding defense combat boil weapon covered enemy defense point many ship get complicated real shame one need look game like master orion see could done better turn based combat system actually let control ship would opened entirely new avenue fun possibility great game almost bug playing well year issue ever encountered strange bug loaded save ship movement could used minor tweaking area truly game year instead great,9.0,0.9909,Positive,,,0.5810500000000001,0.769,0.33025,0.7196,0.00410000000000002,0.9286,0.43435,0.8687,0.1779,0.8687

Look that the NEGATIVE reviews (only EIGHT as of march/2014). They are of people that either:
A) say that they don't like 4x
B) say that the game is too long (do you REALLY expect to conquer a GALAXY in a couple of hours?)
C) say that the game is bad because it only supports one language: English, although the review is in English.
D) says that he likes the old games better
E) reviews Galactic Civ II badly by saying that **** is not a complete game (may be he got the game in the bundle on steam, where both games came together). Man, THIS IS NOT THE GAME YOU ARE REVIEWING.
F) give irrelevant runts and never justify his grade

Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms,Games Farm,"bitComposer, Kalypso",User,7.0,"Good game with some nice ideas and a few major flaws.
In Heretic Kingdoms you take the control of the Devourer: a demon that can eat people's souls and use them as puppets. It's an ARPG in the Diablo style but, due to the Devourer's power, you'll control a variety of different characters instead of a single one. This makes the game feel fresh and interesting.
Too bad the game has some big flaws:
Loading screen are insanely long and there are quite a lot. There's a loading screen even for when you
want to change the party formation - you can have only 3 characters in your party plus the devourer - which made me almost never try new characters combination and killing one of the best characteristics of the game. You can't even equip or level up the inactive characters without traveling to the character select room (which is pointless also because it's just a room with the 'puppets' and a single vendor, there was really no need to have it), leading to a very cluttered inventory. It also kills exploration. You will really spend a insane amount of time on loading screens, and you will think twice about loading the game if you don't have a lot of free time on your hands.
Controls are bad. Really bad. They're unresponsive, the character often stops insted of attacking or just moves away, right mouse button is useless and the feeling is generally very very clunky. The combat feels often like a chore and it's not too funny.
Crafting is very tedious and pointlessly time consuming due to the badly readable interface for it. Absolutely pointless, also because you can never craft items better than what you find.

Now for the good part of it... there are some really good ideas in this. The party system is very interesting and adds something new to a overused genre. The world is beautiful and engaging, and makes you want to know more about it. The graphics are quite good: clean, readable, colorful, stylish.
The musics are absolutely fantastic. My favourite part of the game. They have a sort of arabic influence and are really, really astonishing and never bore the player.

Without striving to be educational, the Paradox title also manages to be an excellent jumping-off point to learn more about the period, its main characters, its social dynamics. The development studio has also done well when it comes to post-launch support. There’s downloadable content, of course, but free patches have also arrived regularly, improving systems and eliminating bugs.

First of all, this game is everything else than outdated because of the Source Code Project. This mod is very easy to install and improve the game extremely, especially the graphic looks well even today. Sound and Music are also good.

So you can focus on the gameplay. The controlling of your ship is perfect: there are a lot of commands, maybe even too many. You need a joystick to enjoy it, but they are so cheap, so I bought one for 30 and get a perfect one (Thrustmasters T Flight Stick X). It takes some time to learn the many functions in the game, but it is worth it.
The problem is, the game is only about fighting in your vessel. The campaign is a series of missions, where you fight most of the time, so it is not diversified and maybe a bit outdated. I prefer the Freelancer style, where you could do much more than shooting all the time.
There is another thing I didnt like in the campaign: You are already focused on fighting and the several hotkeys, but there is so much talking during the fights, that it is almost impossible to understand them.

The story is deep, because it is based on the predecessor and the story was developed there already. So you will need some time to read the background informations. But most of the story is presented by text between the missions, so a bit boring.

The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion,Bethesda Game Studios,"2K Games, Bethesda Softworks, Spike",User,8.0,"Overall: 8/10

A very solid RPG  Elder Scrolls game :) The lore of the Elder Scrolls universe is hard to beat and Oblivion has some awesome additions to the lore, with Martin  the Oblivion Crisis, the Dark Brotherhood  Thieves Guild quest lines being rich in stories, and the Shivering Isles letting you experience Mantling a Daedric Prince. I really love some of the sidequest  books with great stories, like one of the first books you find in the game outside the sewers, detailing a vampire that tricks a vampire hunter to eliminate his competition, posing as a vampire hunter, then kills him once he's finished his usefulness :) The game does wear thin on some storylines, like in the Shivering Isles where I did stop caring very much to do sidequests and the novelty of everyone being crazy wore off after a bit. But the main guilds, Shivering Isles, and the Main Quest actually for me especially all had good stories. I was surprised how much I liked the Main Quest, as so many people talk down on it online. But Martin's character especially elevated the story so much and I really came to respect him  see him as a very worthy successor to the Empire, and was really sad when he had to sacrifice himself.


The Knights of the Nine story for me fell flat, as the threat of Umaril was pretty far off and kind of random, with very little setup at least for me. I know the stories of Pelinal Whitestrake  Umaril fairly well and the game didn't do a great job setting up that history for the player, outside of the books you can read in-game. Pelinal is also not really a good/moral character, so the whole Knights of the Nine holiness and self-righteousness feels extremely hollow but I feel the game wanted you to think they are following a culture/leader who was on the side of good. Except Pelinal was an insane cyborg and/or time-traveller it seems who just was crazy and wanted to kill all non-humans : Anyways all the other main stories in the game were quite good, so this DLC's didn't bring the game down too much for me.

The gameplay was better than I remembered from playing most of the game as a teenager. The sword play  magic systems work well imo, and I miss the ability to make your own spells in Skyrim. I honestly don't mind the sword  board gameplay of Oblivion  Skyrim and think they are fun overall :) The mix of meele, archery, magic,  sneaking is a great formula for Elder Scrolls game and brings lots of options  diversity to a build.

The music is incredible, just amazing :) I would say its a 9/10 compared to like an 11/10 for Skyrim, and I downloaded some of the tracks for Oblivion, while I downloaded every single track from Skyrim.

Minecraft,Mojang AB,"Mojang AB, Microsoft",User,10.0,"Just talking about it, Minecraft is definitely a title that just about every person on the planet has heard of, but it’s actually very difficult to explain unless you’re actually familiar with it. At first, it sounds incredibly basic. Just a blocky world to mine resources, build, and survive. Of course, it is referred to as a sandbox survival game’ title. In most games, you are provided with an objective. The story and levels tell you what to do. Minecraft is not such a game. When you first spawn, you are not provided with some sort of tutorial, and you're left without any sort of cinematic. You start off by finding yourself in just another randomly generated world, and it is up to you to, well, 'figure it out' and explore. You could go along the 'survival' route and obtain some wood, craft yourself a tool, and fend off monsters during the night, but the game never forces it on you. The biggest reason Minecraft stands out is the freedom it gives you. Every part of the world is made of blocks that you can break and place anywhere you want. That means the entire world is basically a giant paint canvas that lets any player who plays the game paint their own vision and lets them do more than just play. If you want to build a massive city, an underground base, a sky island, or even try to recreate real-life landmarks, the game lets you do it. There isn’t a correct way to play, which is very different from most games. Minecraft allows you to play it the way you want because it has lots of worlds, and you can select the ones you prefer. Survival has obstacles to overcome, such as mining resources, exploring caves, and becoming more powerful. In creative mode, you are not restricted to anything. You have infinite resources, and you can fly. You also don’t have to concern yourself with death so that you can explore and build. It is not really a game but more of a digital palette where people can show their expression. Minecraft is cool since it mixes a bunch of game types into one. Sometimes it feels like you're just trying to survive, sometimes it feels like you're on some crazy quest. And, you can build stuff, or just hang out with friends on a server! One day you might explore a lot of caves. Next, you might decorate your house. Then maybe you go trade with villagers, or play mini games other players made. In the end, what makes Minecraft so great is the amount of control it allows the player to have. The game never puts it into your head what it is you are supposed to be doing, it lets you decide. Whether it is beating the Ender Dragon, doing something creative, such as building an impressive structure, or just exploring, it allows you to do what it is you want to. These are the elements of why people continually go back to Minecraft every year.","['talking', 'definitely', 'title', 'every', 'person', 'planet', 'heard', 'actually', 'difficult', 'explain', 'unless', 'actually', 'familiar', 'first', 'sound', 'incredibly', 'basic', 'blocky', 'world', 'mine', 'resource', 'build', 'survive', 'course', 'referred', 'sandbox', 'survival', 'game', 'title', 'game', 'provided', 'objective', 'story', 'level', 'tell', 'game', 'first', 'spawn', 'provided', 'sort', 'tutorial', 'left', 'without', 'sort', 'cinematic', 'start', 'finding', 'another', 'randomly', 'generated', 'world', 'well', 'explore', 'could', 'go', 'along', 'route', 'obtain', 'wood', 'craft', 'tool', 'fend', 'monster', 'night', 'game', 'never', 'force', 'biggest', 'reason', 'stand', 'freedom', 'give', 'every', 'part', 'world', 'made', 'block', 'break', 'place', 'anywhere', 'want', 'mean', 'entire', 'world', 'basically', 'giant', 'paint', 'canvas', 'let', 'player', 'play', 'game', 'paint', 'vision', 'let', 'play', 'want', 'build', 'massive', 'city', 'underground', 'base', 'sky', 'island', 'even', 'try', 'recreate', 'landmark', 'game', 'let', 'correct', 'way', 'play', 'different', 'game', 'allows', 'play', 'way', 'want', 'lot', 'world', 'select', 'one', 'prefer', 'survival', 'obstacle', 'overcome', 'mining', 'resource', 'exploring', 'cave', 'becoming', 'powerful', 'creative', 'mode', 'restricted', 'anything', 'infinite', 'resource', 'fly', 'also', 'concern', 'death', 'explore', 'build', 'really', 'game', 'digital', 'palette', 'people', 'show', 'expression', 'cool', 'since', 'mix', 'bunch', 'game', 'type', 'one', 'sometimes', 'feel', 'like', 'trying', 'survive', 'sometimes', 'feel', 'like', 'crazy', 'quest', 'build', 'stuff', 'hang', 'friend', 'server', 'one', 'day', 'might', 'explore', 'lot', 'cave', 'next', 'might', 'decorate', 'house', 'maybe', 'go', 'trade', 'villager', 'play', 'mini', 'game', 'player', 'made', 'end', 'make', 'great', 'amount', 'control', 'allows', 'player', 'game', 'never', 'put', 'head', 'supposed', 'let', 'decide', 'whether', 'beating', 'ender', 'dragon', 'something', 'creative', 'building', 'impressive', 'structure', 'exploring', 'allows', 'want', 'element', 'people', 'continually', 'go', 'back', 'every', 'year']",talking definitely title every person planet heard actually difficult explain unless actually familiar first sound incredibly basic blocky world mine resource build survive course referred sandbox survival game title game provided objective story level tell game first spawn provided sort tutorial left without sort cinematic start finding another randomly generated world well explore could go along route obtain wood craft tool fend monster night game never force biggest reason stand freedom give every part world made block break place anywhere want mean entire world basically giant paint canvas let player play game paint vision let play want build massive city underground base sky island even try recreate landmark game let correct way play different game allows play way want lot world select one prefer survival obstacle overcome mining resource exploring cave becoming powerful creative mode restricted anything infinite resource fly also concern death explore build really game digital palette people show expression cool since mix bunch game type one sometimes feel like trying survive sometimes feel like crazy quest build stuff hang friend server one day might explore lot cave next might decorate house maybe go trade villager play mini game player made end make great amount control allows player game never put head supposed let decide whether beating ender dragon something creative building impressive structure exploring allows want element people continually go back every year,10.0,0.9929,Positive,-0.08155000000000001,0.0973875,0.06004999999999999,0.0,0.11697142857142857,0.7384,0.12656666666666666,0.0,0.09093333333333332,0.251175,0.26275,

Grand Theft Auto: Vice City,Rockstar North,"Rockstar Games, SCEA, Capcom",User,7.0,"I think this is much better than GTA 3, a massive step up in sandbox opportunity with motorbikes, planes, helicopters and actual working boats.

Tommy seems like the most competent of the GTA protagonists, he enjoys his job and is good at it. Much different to the GTA 4/5 protagonists who (while efficient) constantly seem like they don't want to do any of this and are instead acting out of anger or doing it for someone else.

Not a Shakespeare level story but pretty decently written and interesting. My favourite quests were the biker gangs, the cab missions after you buy it as an asset and the 'film studio' ones.

I love love LOVE how fast you can run in this game, i feel like a jacked psychopath protagonist which is absolutely the vibe.

Speaking of, the general vibe, colour pallette, music and fashion do such a really good job of showing the 80's time period. Banger after banger on the radio, i added a bunch to my spotify. 

so if i like the game so much, why is is the same as my GTA 3 score?
well one it would be a 7.4 if i could actually rate this how i want, above gta 3's strict 7. **** metacritics rating system.

more importantly two, there are so many controller throwing, unnecessarily hard, punishing, long winded missions and sections that made it an incredibly frustrating playthrough, much more than the first game. 

the game lies saying there is checkpoints, but it just restarts you at the beginning of the mission. while this was in the previous game this is much more frustrating because Vice City has much longer multi-layered missions compared to GTA 3.

The game also is not obvious in progression of missions, certain character quests one after another end without a sense of conclusion. I rarely knew, at the end of all missions with a character, that it was the end. 

This carries over into requirements to get the ending. I had finished every single mission i possibly could, including all of the gang missions on both sides of the gang war, I even did a telephone and basic cab driving mission which in any other circumstance i would never do. I had no idea what to do from there, or whether i had already finished all the missions unbeknownst to me.

WELL turns out i should have been buying property the entire time! the OPTIONAL properties have their own missions which when you complete about 20, after buying EVERY SINGLE CHAIN, then you can play the final two missions and finish the game :3

This comes out of NOWHERE, and hit me like a truck. I had spent all of the money I had got in the game on ammo and guns, oversupplying myself because the game did such a poor job at explaining what else i could do with it. I was then softlocked out of getting the ending because i was broke, and couldn't get more money because i had done all the missions already. 

This forced me to reload a save from hours ago losing progress and do a glitched mission called 'Cone Crazy' which if you do right, gives you millions if you get good at beating your score. 

Finally after about 40 mins of grinding and an hour or two of doing what i had already done, I could do the missions which took about four hours. 

there was a whole 1/3 of the game unknown to me because the game never highlighted it was possible. I had to find it online out of disbelief. When I looked at the comment section for the tutorial on how to get the ending, there were dozens of commentors saying they had been stuck as I had for DECADES with no idea what to do or where to go.

really bad game design.

and this especially **** because Vice Cities ending kicks ass, there is a decent twist and you get a scarface showdown in your mansion against the main antagonist of the game. it's really sad most people won't get to experience it, because they were never directed in the ways to unlock it.

despite my gripes with the process to get the last half, i still had quite a blast and enjoyed playing.","['think', 'much', 'better', 'gta', 'massive', 'step', 'sandbox', 'opportunity', 'motorbike',

Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory,Ubisoft Montreal,Ubisoft,User,9.0,"Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory stands as a landmark in the stealth genre, and even after all these years, it continues to impress with its outstanding design and execution. Visually, the game was a technical marvel at its time of release, featuring excellent lighting, detailed environments, and atmospheric effects that still manage to hold up surprisingly **** narrative, while not the most emotionally gripping, is solid and keeps the player intrigued throughout. It does a good job of setting the tone for the missions and immersing you in the geopolitical tension of the world. The characters, especially Sam Fisher, are well-voiced and charismatic, helping to maintain the immersion even when the plot slows down.Where Chaos Theory truly excels is in its stealth gameplay. The level design encourages exploration and multiple approaches, rewarding players for being patient, observant, and creative. Stealth mechanics are deep and finely tuned, allowing for precise control over light, sound, and movement. It's not just about staying hiddenit's about mastering your environment. The game challenges you to think like a spy, and pulling off a perfect silent takedown or ghosting through a level without being detected is incredibly **** game also adds layers of realism and immersion that were ahead of their time. From the way guards react to sound and light, to the tools and gadgets at Sam’s disposal, everything contributes to a sense of tension and **** there’s one area that might not hit as hard today, it’s the story’s emotional depth, which feels more like a backdrop than a driving force. However, this is easily forgiven considering how polished and rewarding the core gameplay is.Overall, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory delivers a deeply satisfying experience for fans of stealth. It’s a title that respects the player’s intelligence and patience, and it rewards those who take the time to truly engage with its systems. Whether you're revisiting it or playing for the first time, it’s a must-play that remains one of the best in the genre.","['stand', 'landmark', 'stealth', 'genre', 'even', 'year', 'continues', 'impress', 'outstanding', 'design', 'execution', 'visually', 'game', 'technical', 'marvel', 'time', 'release', 'featuring', 'excellent', 'lighting', 'detailed', 'environment', 'atmospheric', 'effect', 'still', 'manage', 'hold', 'surprisingly', 'narrative', 'emotionally', 'gripping', 'solid', 'keep', 'player', 'intrigued', 'throughout', 'good', 'job', 'setting', 'tone', 'mission', 'immersing', 'geopolitical', 'tension', 'world', 'character', 'especially', 'sam', 'fisher', 'charismatic', 'helping', 'maintain', 'immersion', 'even', 'plot', 'slows', 'truly', 'excels', 'stealth', 'gameplay', 'level', 'design', 'encourages', 'exploration', 'multiple', 'approach', 'rewarding', 'player', 'patient', 'observant', 'creative', 'stealth', 'mechanic', 'deep', 'finely', 'tuned', 'allowing', 'precise', 'control', 'light', 'sound', 'movement', 'staying', 'hiddenit', 'mastering', 'environment', 'game', 'challenge', 'think', 'like', 'spy', 'pulling', 'perfect', 'silent', 'takedown', 'ghosting', 'level', 'without', 'detected', 'incredibly', 'game', 'also', 'add', 'layer', 'realism', 'immersion', 'ahead', 'time', 'way', 'guard', 'react', 'sound', 'light', 'tool', 'gadget', 'sam', 'disposal', 'everything', 'contributes', 'sense', 'tension', 'one', 'area', 'might', 'hit', 'hard', 'today', 'story', 'emotional', 'depth', 'feel', 'like', 'backdrop', 'driving', 'force', 'however', 'easily', 'forgiven', 'considering', 'polished', 'rewarding', 'core', 'gameplay', 'delivers', 'deeply', 'satisfying', 'experience', 'fan', 'stealth', 'title', 'respect', 'player', 'intelligence', 'patience', 'reward', 'take', 'time', 'truly', 'engage', 'system', 'whether', 'revisiting', 'playing', 'first', 'time', 'remains', 'one', 'best', 'genre']",stand landmark stealth genre even year continues impress outstanding design execution visually game technical marvel time release featuring excellent lighting detailed environment atmospheric effect still manage hold surprisingly narrative emotionally gripping solid keep player intrigued throughout good job setting tone mission immersing geopolitical tension world character especially sam fisher charismatic helping maintain immersion even plot slows truly excels stealth gameplay level design encourages exploration multiple approach rewarding player patient observant creative stealth mechanic deep finely tuned allowing precise control light sound movement staying hiddenit mastering environment game challenge think like spy pulling perfect silent takedown ghosting level without detected incredibly game also add layer realism immersion ahead time way guard react sound light tool gadget sam disposal everything contributes sense tension one area might hit hard today story emotional depth feel like backdrop driving force however easily forgiven considering polished rewarding core gameplay delivers deeply satisfying experience fan stealth title respect player intelligence patience reward take time truly engage system whether revisiting playing first time remains one best genre,9.0,0.9955,Positive,0.5823,0.46406000000000003,0.42595,0.48552,0.5897666666666667,-0.0772,0.41620000000000007,,,0.5962999999999999,0.70465,

Each mod is like rediscovering something I already love but through a brand-new lens.

Hoodwink,E-One Studio,E-One Studio,User,4.0,"Simply walking around the world of Hoodwink is a chore- the walk cursor only appears intermittently, forcing you to click in several areas until you find the path that has been laid out by the developers... which is usually broken up by interactive  objects, so you have to inch closer to them until the camera scrolls and you can click on the space of road directly after them.

Michael walks rather slowly, but double-clicking will activate his running mode. Unfortunately our hero has a tendency to rubber-band back and forth on certain screens when running, taking longer to cover ground than simply walking. Some exits, such as the exit to the main plaza, are not actually marked. In almost every other room, hovering the cursor over exits immediately morphs the cursor into a door, letting you know there is an exit-- this is not the case for the exit to the plaza, which is a nondescript-looking  landing that only displays the regular walking icon.

Movement alone, however, is not the only obstacle the player must surmount. Hotspot recognition is extremely finicky, which is aggravated by very poor puzzle design. Developers nowadays must walk a thin line between avoiding the heights of insanity we've seen in some adventure game puzzles of ages past (use an inflatable rubber duck to rescue a key from a canal? The Longest Journey, I'm looking at you...) and avoiding serving everything to the player on a silver platter. Sadly, Hoodwink does serve things on a silver platter. An example of this is the first quest you come upon: As soon as you have escaped from Detective Pyre's  office, you decide to talk to your hippie friend (Saffron) for advice on how to pull off your proposal. Her advice? You need to get some chocolates, make yourself smell good, and get your paws on a bouquet of roses.

How difficult is it to achieve these goals? Not difficult at all. In fact, all you need to do is go up one floor, stroll around, and just pick things up as you find them. Two items require you to interact with one character and one element of the environment respectively, and the chocolates require you to find a certain individual in the plaza (and, of course, figure out where that exit is...)  and that's it, the challenge is pretty much nonexistent. Later puzzles, such as the one involving a lantern, feel like filler to pad out the experience more than anything else and really don't flow well at all.  Puzzles are not necessarily the backbone of adventure games- characters and settings are- but when you have them, they need to reinforce the experience instead of detracting from it.

These glaring issues are a real shame, because the world of Hoodwink is fascinating. Although not explored at length, the quirky society with its odd denizens and rather black sense of humor do beg for your attention, and you'll be wanting to see more of it by the time the curtain comes down.

The graphics are eccentrically unique, a blend of gritty dystopian and cartoony playfulness realized in cel-shaded 3D. Characters do make an impression with their personalities:  a second-chancer robot who thinks he still has a stomach, a trash can who is trying to commit suicide by jumping into an incinerator, the anachronistically flower-powered Saffron, and of course your fiancée- the game has more than its share of excellent characterization, and this is the area where it truly shines. The universe is also positively bizarre- if anthropomorphic detectives and brain-carrying robots weren't enough, mutations have also affected flowers: Saffron's supply room is populated by a large carnivorous plant that guards over a crowd of dancing, anthropomorphic roses. Some good throwaway comedy lines can be  heard in crowd scenes - but their impact is lessened  when heard for the tenth time, repeated by different voice actors (a slight déjà vu of Oblivion's rather schizophrenic voice acting.) Perhaps one of my favorite lines comes from UniCorp's boys in blue, constantly and cheerfully reminding passersby that 'Unlawfulness will be met with courteous and lethal response!'

The music is more of a mixed bag- although the sparse soundtrack is stylistically appropriate to match the future-dystopia-meets-noir theme, traclks seem to be triggered at random and after long periods of silence with no discernible rhyme or reason: At one point a tune sprung up in the middle of a lengthy conversation with Saffron, and at least two themes were playing simultaneously when I entered her supply room.","['simply', 'walking', 'around', 'world', 'walk', 'cursor', 'appears', 'intermittently', 'forcing', 'click', 'several', 'area', 'find', 'path', 'laid', 'developer',

The graphics are impressive  especially on the PC version  with detailed environments and beautiful lighting effects that make the island of Medici feel alive. The controls are also generally smooth and responsive, which makes flying and using the wingsuit really enjoyable.However, the game isn’t perfect. One major flaw is the NPCs  they all sound almost identical when shouting or reacting, which breaks immersion and makes the world feel repetitive. Some missions also feel completely unnecessary or filler, adding little to the overall experience. On top of that, many missions feel repetitive, often using the same objectives and structure, which can make the gameplay feel a bit stale over **** biggest downside, though, is the driving mechanics. Vehicle control feels stiff and unpolished compared to the rest of the gameplay. It’s frustrating, especially when missions force you to drive for long stretches.Overall, Just Cause 3 is a visually stunning and entertaining sandbox experience that shines when you’re blowing things up, but it’s held back by repetitive missions, weak NPC variety, and clunky driving.Score: 7/10","['action', 'game', 'delivers', 'pure', 'chaos', 'fun', 'especially', 'come', 'explosion', 'creative', 'destruction', 'graphic', 'impressive', 'especially', 'pc', 'version', 'detailed', 'environment', 'beautiful', 'lighting', 'effect', 'make', 'island', 'medici', 'feel', 'alive', 'control', 'also', 'generally', 'smooth', 'responsive', 'make', 'flying', 'using', 'wingsuit', 'really', 'game', 'perfect', 'one', 'major', 'flaw', 'npc', 'sound', 'almost', 'identical', 'shouting', 'reacting', 'break', 'immersion', 'make', 'world', 'feel', 'repetitive', 'mission', 'also', 'feel', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'filler', 'adding', 'little', 'overall', 'experience', 'top', 'many', 'mission', 'feel', 'repetitive', 'often', 'using', 'objective', 'structure', 'make', 'gameplay', 'feel', 'bit', 'stale', 'biggest', 'downside', 'though', 'driving', 'mechanic', 'vehicle', 'control', 'feel', 'stiff', 'unpolished', 'compared', 'rest', 'gameplay', 'frustrating', 'especially', 'mission', 'force', 'drive', 'long', 'visually', 'stunning', 'entertaining', 'sandbox', 'experience', 'shine', 'blowing', 'thing', 'held', 'back', 'repetitive', 'mission', 'weak', 'npc', 'variety', 'clunky']",action game delivers pure chaos fun especially come explosion creative destruction graphic impressive especially pc version detailed environment beautiful lighting effect make island medici feel alive control also generally smooth responsive make flying using wingsuit really game perfect one major flaw npc sound almost identical shouting reacting break immersion make world feel repetitive mission also feel completely unnecessary filler adding little overall experience top many mission feel repetitive often using objective structure make gameplay feel bit stale biggest downside though driving mechanic vehicle control feel stiff unpolished compared rest gameplay frustrating especially mission force drive long visually stunning entertaining sandbox experience shine blowing thing held back repetitive mission weak npc variety clunky,7.0,-0.7579,Negative,,-0.25415,0.01865,0.055499999999999994,-0.28595,-0.03216666666666668,-0.43394999999999995,,0.7351,-0.4678333333333333,,

What a fun game.  Aside from accidentally hitting the 'start a new game' button when I was at 98 completion, completing the game in its entirety again was actually enjoyable.  Do yourself a favour and get the Bavarian Wingsuit (From the first DLC) as early as you can.  It will make the game much more enjoyable.

Beautiful open world.
Good balance of difficulty 
Good (but short) story line.

Javi, the chick he bangs and the kids are just meaningless, washed out bots whose slaughter wouldn't force out of me anything except for a sigh of relief. And hope that someone with an actual personality might replace them.

The Walking Dead: The Telltale Series - A New Frontier Episode 3: Above the Law,Telltale Games,Telltale Games,User,,"TL;DR - Offensive to S1 and S2 players.
Rest in bloody peace: a series which once used to be great.

As expected, almost none of the issues were addressed in Episode 3. It took them 4 bloody months to release this episode and it's still a bad episode (but better than Ep1 and 2 - but that doesn't say much since Episode 1 and 2 were so bad that anything could top it) and short as **** Literally the only thing they listened to was that there's at least some more character development this episode but still no hubs and a determinant character wasn't killed at the start of the Episode and was handled pretty damn well - but that's it. That's all they improved on. Episode 3 was **** and it does not save the season from the abysmal state it's in. This season shouldn't even exist. It's not the official S3. We played as Clementine in Season 2 and shaped our Clementine, and now Clementine is a supporting character again plus her personality doesn't change at all depending on your choices last season. The story is awful, and Clem is just a side character shoe-horned in when she was pretty much the main character for the previous two seasons. This isn't Clem's story, this is Javier's story - so this shouldn't even have Clem in it if Telltale wants to tell Javier's story so badly because she's just shoe-horned in and a side character. All the false advertising pre-release doesn't help either. Her being in every ****ing advertisement also doesn't help.

Ep1 and 2 (3 is pretty much the same):

Short 60 minute episodes (and the awful story makes it even worse), Clementine is playable for 5 minutes per ep, false advertisting pre-release, this is Javier's story for whatever **** reason even though we never asked for this and just wanted a GOOD continuation of Clementine's story (but this is an ABYSMAL continuation - this shouldn't even be called S3), The story is awful, and Clem is just a side character shoe-horned in when she was pretty much the main character for the previous two seasons. This isn't Clem's story, this is Javier's story - so this shouldn't even have Clem in it if Telltale wants to tell Javier's story so badly because she's just shoe-horned in and a side character.

We played as Clementine in Season 2 and shaped our Clementine, and now Clementine is a supporting character again plus her personality doesn't change at all depending on your choices last season. Easy choices and deaths don't affect you because there is not enough character development and the game just pushes you forwards without any chance to talk to characters like in Season 1 (and even S2).

It’s not particularly trailblazing, but it knows what it’s trying to convey, and it uses a pretty concise visual metaphor to get it across.

I don’t believe it is as distasteful as Epic or Steam does, and I still am surprised that something that feels mostly tame and along the lines of an A24 horror film has caused such controversy. If Horses didn’t expose anything we didn’t already know about the dangers of a sheltered, puritanical lifestyle, it at least unmasked Steam and Epic as cowardly companies that can’t be bothered to actually vet the work they’re barring from entry.

Testament: The Order of High-Human,Fairyship Games,Fairyship Games,User,8.0,"After playing for some times, I think the game is overwhelmingly underrated.
The game seems very good at all especially for a small team, don't forget it's an indie game.
IMO the biggest mistake of this small team is to want to show a big game that is bigger than their team's ability and of course surprisingly they have been successful in some of them.
Combat system is a little lacking in making right sense and the game gets boring over time, but the game ultimately conveys a good feeling and is fun.
Graphic looks great and runs smoothly even on my old PC, there are some minor issues here and there, but it is completely acceptable for a game at this price and even better than many big budget games.
The voice acting was also good for me because I am not a naive English person and I didn't feel any problem about.

Avec Evoland 2, les développeurs de Shiro Games ont vu les choses en beaucoup plus grand : plus long, plus ambitieux, plus varié. Mais cette générosité n’est pas sans **** incarne Kuro, un héros qui voyage à travers différentes époques avec ses alliés pour tenter de percer les secrets des Magi et de leurs mystérieux Magilithes, sur fond de guerre entre démons et humains. Les voyages dans le temps, clairement inspirés de Chrono Trigger, apportent autant de variété narrative que de dépaysement visuel. On retrouve même une carte du monde qui rappelle directement le chef-d’uvre de Square **** grande originalité du jeu réside dans ses changements de style graphique et de gameplay. On commence avec une esthétique Game Boy, puis l’on traverse des phases façon GBA, SNES, et même des passages en 3D qui rappellent la Nintendo DS. Mais Evoland 2 ne se limite pas aux clins d’il visuels : il multiplie aussi les références aux genres. L’action-aventure à la Zelda reste la base, mais au fil de l’aventure, on tombe sur des séquences qui évoquent Metal Gear, Street Fighter II, Mario, les Tortues Ninja, et bien d’autres. Le jeu n’hésite pas à briser le quatrième mur, à jouer avec les codes du média, et à cultiver un humour **** gameplay principal s’appuie sur la progression classique d’un action-RPG : combats, montée de niveau, gestion d’un inventaire, amélioration de l’attaque, de la défense et de la vie. Mais on peut aussi invoquer des alliés qui prêtent leurs pouvoirs, ce qui enrichit les possibilités stratégiques. En parallèle, des mini-jeux et des phases plus expérimentales viennent régulièrement casser la routine.Evoland 2 est indéniablement un vrai jeu, plus qu’une simple expérience comme le premier. Comptez une dizaine d’heures pour en voir la fin, avec une aventure riche, variée et ponctuée de rebondissements. Mais cette ambition a un revers : le titre souffre d’un rythme inégal. Là où le premier pouvait se parcourir d’une traite et gardait une intensité constante, le second s’éparpille, s’étire et risque de perdre en route une partie des joueurs. Certaines phases de gameplay, bien qu’amusantes en clin d’il, révèlent vite leurs limites face aux uvres dont elles **** sent l’amour des développeurs pour le jeu vidéo dans chaque détail, mais aussi leurs limites techniques : en voulant rendre hommage à trop de genres, ils peinent parfois à égaler la qualité des originaux. Résultat : une aventure attachante, pleine de bonnes idées, mais parfois **** conclusion, Evoland 2 est un chouette voyage, généreux et bourré de références, qui séduira ceux qui ont apprécié le premier. Mais il ne possède pas la même efficacité ni la même fraîcheur. Plus long, plus dispersé, il montre aussi les difficultés d’équilibrer hommage, expérimentation et cohérence. On peut rêver d’un Evoland 3, qui irait encore plus loin en traversant l’histoire du jeu vidéo jusqu’à nos technologies actuelles, mais pour l’heure, ce deuxième épisode reste une belle curiosité à

Evoland 2: A Slight Case of Spacetime Continuum Disorder,Shiro Games,Shiro Games,User,7.0,"The game could have used a bit more polish as I noticed a few typos in the dialog and some things were cut off on the edge of the screen. There were also a few minor bugs along the way, but no big deal. I really enjoyed most of the game and the level design, especially the tactical RPG mode. I had a good time with all genre modes. The game relies a little too much on nostalgia and throwback ideas, which I am well aware is the premise of the game, but it's just not quite my thing. The dialog and story is basic and I think the game could have benefitted from a few quality of life improvements. The overworld is very small, but cozy. Difficulty and length was just right for me.

Runaway: A Road Adventure,Pendulo Studios,"Tri Synergy, Focus Home Interactive, Dinamic Multimedia, Crimson Cow, Ascaron Entertainment, Peter Games",User,6.0,"A light-haired man out traveling meets a dark-haired woman and goes on a global adventure involving an old artifact. Sound familiar? No, this isn’t Broken Sword, though the first game in that series did come first. This is Runaway: A Road Adventure, featuring the exploits of Brian Basco, college student, and Gina Timmins, a lounge singer (actually a stripper) who witnessed a murder by the mafia. While the gameplay and mechanics are a typical point  click affair, the story and characters are very colorful and engaging. For a game that had trouble before, during, and after production, it’s pretty amazing that it was ever released. Though it equal parts surprised and disappointed me, I enjoyed it and can see why it did so well in Spain and, eventually, the US.
Let’s start with Brian. He’s supposed to be a nerd, but I never really got that impression. Sure he’s rather smart and wears glasses, but he seems more like a regular guy. Maybe it’s because of how he’s designed. If the developers were going for a stereotypical nerd look, they would’ve made him much skinnier. I saw a comment on Twitter that described another character as a nerd wearing a varsity jacket,’ and I think this explains Brian pretty well. He was initially going to college to study applied physics, after all. And the way he solves some of the game’s puzzles could only happen with some clever, creative thinking. Even though the story is linear and Brian can’t die, you still feel a sense of urgency when combining items together knowing the Mafia could show up at any minute. Something I appreciated about Brian is that he wasn’t the typical man some adventure games have. He effortlessly stitched a basketball, wasn’t afraid to carry around some lipstick, and treated three drag queens with respect. That’s impressive, considering this was 2001.
I was also impressed by the backgrounds in this game, though they did seem a little busy. From Manhattan to Arizona, there was always something to look at. Even something as simple as a bathroom had multiple items in it. One of the more detailed places was the Museum of Archeology and Natural History. There were some dinosaur skeletons on display, and you could practically count every single bone. And the artifact restoration room was filled with shelves of items and various gadgets from floor to ceiling. The analyses laboratory didn’t skimp on crazy details either, what with all the computers and scanners and such. Though the characters stood out from the backgrounds, given how they were animated, you still really felt like you were in the same places. I hope the people who worked on the backgrounds were paid well enough.
So where did Runaway: A Road Adventure fall short? Sigh, where do I even begin? A lot of this is product of its time’ stuff but should still be talked about. There was a short, black man who was an informant for the Mafia with the nickname Munchkin Bob.’ Calling a little person that can be considered both infantilizing and dehumanizing. Also, and this is a great personal grievance of mine, Native Americas were constantly referred to as Indians throughout the game. And this is after Brian actually called them Native Americans to start with. As if things couldn’t get offensive enough, he meets a character named Joshua in the desert who’s a horribly racist Japanese stereotype. Fake accent, buck teeth, ill-fitting clothes, the works. And this is from a game company in Spain. You would expect this sort of thing from America, but apparently, it’s a global problem. The stiff, robotic animation is a whole other argument, but that mostly can be forgiven due to the fact that a, it’s 2001, and b, the developers at Pendulo Studios were in constant financial crisis.
Other missteps include having to go pixel hunting for certain objects, as they blend with the backgrounds a little too well, along with some of the puzzles not being solved in a logical way. There’s a lot of trial and error trying to figure out what combines and what doesn’t, which takes away from enjoying the game. Plus, when planning to save Gina in the desert, Brian repeats the plan the more items he gets to help him enact it. Like, you don’t need to repeat the whole plan every single time, just mention the new parts. Players are smarter than you think. And Brian gave up on Gina a little too quickly after she fell down a hole. At least try to look for her first before thinking she’s dead. Speaking of Gina, while I wasn’t thrilled with her outfit choices (especially in the desert; seriously, boobs can get sunburnt too), the fact that she was more of a plot device than a character didn’t do her justice. If Brian hadn’t accidently hit her with his car, they never would’ve met and she probably would’ve died. She goes through so much throughout the course of the game and yet she’s regulated to a secondary character. There’s more to her than just looks, and I find myself wondering how things would’ve been different if she was the protagonist.","['man', 'traveling', 'meet', 'woman', 'go', 'global', 'involving',

And that within those combinations, that your societies values still matter. I tie in that even impeached republican Richard Nixon ran a free market democracy, but that he prioritized knowledge as a core value. And that from the high school movement in the 1920s forward, having knowledge as our values is what enabled us to become so strong.

And contrast it with Wealth values policies like tax cuts for the wealthy while ignoring the knowledge values policies to make education accessible to everyone, that were already proven successful in our own history....

And then I use the Future Societies to hammer it into people's heads that eventually we will progress past many outdated views. Cybernetic utilizes automation to free humans for more creative tasks. Eudemonic encourages citizens to achieve happiness through fulfillment in a tolerant society without violence. Or we can continue the path of Thought Control, using triggers that create a population that is obedient, loyal, and rejects outside ideas....

DRIV3R,Reflections Interactive,Atari SA,User,6.0,"Definitely a game with a lot of wasted potential. The driving physics have aged amazingly well, car deformation is extremely good for 2004 standards, and the action it provides in high speed chases is enough to keep you engaged and get through the undercover mode. However, the most criticized aspect of this title is obvious as soon as you play any of the game modes where Tanner is able to move on foot, which is when you notice the awkward movement the developers designed(or where designing at that point of the game, which is of course in an unfinished state). Shooting segments feel dull and cheap due to this issue. Bugs and glitches are always present, and these may ruin the single player story mode in any of the available missions, making attempts of beating undercover mode more frustrating than they should be. If Atari had not pressured Reflections to release the game before the correct date of launch, DRIV3R could have beaten the now giant Grand Theft Auto series, but unrealistic deadlines and an unstable state of release, made the third title to one of the best driving games from the end of the 1990’s a failure which would affect the rest of the franchise’s games.","['definitely', 'game', 'lot', 'wasted', 'potential', 'driving', 'physic', 'aged', 'amazingly', 'well', 'car', 'deformation', 'extremely', 'good', 'standard', 'action', 'provides', 'high', 'speed', 'chase', 'enough', 'keep', 'engaged', 'get', 'undercover', 'mode', 'however', 'criticized', 'aspect', 'title', 'obvious', 'soon', 'play', 'game', 'mode', 'tanner', 'able', 'move', 'foot', 'notice', 'awkward', 'movement', 'developer', 'designed', 'designing', 'point', 'game', 'course', 'unfinished', 'state', 'shooting', 'segment', 'feel', 'dull', 'cheap', 'due', 'issue', 'bug', 'glitch', 'always', 'present', 'may', 'ruin', 'single', 'player', 'story', 'mode', 'available', 'mission', 'making', 'attempt', 'beating', 'undercover', 'mode', 'frustrating', 'atari', 'pressured', 'reflection', 'release', 'game', 'correct', 'date', 'launch', 'could', 'beaten', 'giant', 'grand', 'theft', 'auto', 'series', 'unrealistic', 'deadline', 'unstable', 'state', 'release', 'made', 'third', 'title', 'one', 'best', 'driving', 'game', 'end', 'failure', 'would', 'affect', 'rest', 'franchise', 'game']",definitely game lot wasted potential driving physic aged amazingly well car deformation extremely good standard action provides high speed chase enough keep engaged get undercover mode however criticized aspect title obvious soon play game mode tanner able move foot notice awkward movement developer designed designing point game course unfinished state shooting segment feel dull cheap due issue bug glitch always present may ruin single player story mode available mission making attempt beating undercover mode frustrating atari pressured reflection release game correct date launch could beaten giant grand theft auto series unrealistic deadline unstable state release made third title one best driving game end failure would affect rest franchise game,6.0,-0.6825,Negative,-0.49725,,,-0.5256,-0.2489,-0.5256,-0.46375,-0.8748,-0.8748,-0.1979,,-0.4019
DRIV3R,Reflections Interactive,Atari SA,User,6.0,"A game which effectively slowed a series' success by trying to mimic its competition's strong points, Driver 3 anything but good -- but its not without merit either. There's some interesting ideas interwoven within this game that could've made this a moderate success otherwise.
I really enjoyed the graphics, and the way that this game chose to present its story. The storyline, and the three main setting featured are highly reminiscent of action films from directors such as Michael Mann and Quentin Tarantino. It's no doubt that Driver 3 is one of the best looking games from the original Xbox / PS2 era - and the visuals are elevated by the Nice and Istanbul locations that you visit throughout the course of the game.
As with previous Driver games, the core mechanics of driving and car chases have always been a high point and the same can be said here. Some of the game's missions, particularly ones focused on vehicle sections, were made memorable as a result of the way vehicle physics are handled. It's also really exhilarating to see cars explode, but vehicle explosions aren't too great since you can still enter the same car as a wrecked chasse.
While I found the driving controls very responsive and made the game more fun, I really didn't understand the need for the on-foot combat sections; the shooting is really boring and I just wanted each section to be over and done with. The AI also felt extremely basic and poorly-scripted, enemies will stay in place and don't really seem to move all that much - making a lot of combat scenarios much easier than they should be. Beyond that, I also experienced a handful of bugs during my time of play. Many of the bugs I witnessed froze or soft locked my console and ultimately forced me to reset.
Would I recommend this game to anyone? Probably not. But if you have a love games from this time period, or even have a strong passion for action, you may find something that you will like about Driver 3 - but don't take my word for it. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas came out much stronger than this one, and is much more recommendable in my books.","['game', 'effectively', 'slowed', 'series', 'success', 'trying', 'mimic', 'competition', 'strong', 'point', 'driver', 'anything', 'good', 'without', 'merit', 'either', 'interesting', 'idea', 'interwoven', 'within', 'game', 'could', 'made', 'moderate', 'success', 'otherwise', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'graphic', 'way', 'game', 'chose', 'present', 'story', 'storyline', 'three', 'main', 'setting', 'featured', 'highly', 'reminiscent', 'action', 'film', 'director', 'michael', 'mann', 'quentin', 'tarantino', 'doubt', 'driver', 'one', 'best', 'looking', 'game', 'original', 'xbox', 'era', 'visuals', 'elevated', 'nice', 'istanbul', 'location', 'visit', 'throughout', 'course', 'game', 'previous', 'driver', 'game', 'core', 'mechanic', 'driving', 'car', 'chase', 'always', 'high', 'point', 'said', 'game', 'mission', 'particularly', 'one', 'focused', 'vehicle', 'section', 'made', 'memorable', 'result', 'way', 'vehicle', 'physic', 'handled', 'also', 'really', 'exhilarating', 'see', 'car', 'explode', 'vehicle', 'explosion', 'great', 'since', 'still', 'enter', 'car', 'wrecked', 'chasse', 'found', 'driving', 'control', 'responsive', 'made', 'game', 'fun', 'really', 'understand', 'need', 'combat', 'section', 'shooting', 'really', 'boring', 'wanted', 'section', 'done', 'ai', 'also', 'felt', 'extremely', 'basic', 'enemy', 'stay', 'place', 'really', 'seem', 'move', 'much', 'making', 'lot', 'combat', 'scenario', 'much', 'easier', 'beyond', 'also', 'experienced', 'handful', 'bug', 'time', 'play', 'many', 'bug', 'witnessed', 'froze', 'soft', 'locked', 'console', 'ultimately', 'forced', 'reset', 'would', 'recommend', 'game', 'anyone', 'probably', 'love', 'game', 'time', 'period', 'even', 'strong', 'passion', 'action', 'may', 'find', 'something', 'like', 'driver', 'take', 'word', 'grand', 'theft', 'auto', 'san', 'andreas', 'came', 'much', 'stronger', 'one', 'much', 'recommendable', 'book']",game effectively slowed series success trying mimic competition strong point driver anything good without merit either interesting idea interwoven within game could made moderate success otherwise really enjoyed graphic way game chose present story storyline three main setting featured highly reminiscent action film director michael mann quentin tarantino doubt driver one best looking game original xbox era visuals elevated nice istanbul location visit throughout course game previous driver game core mechanic driving car chase always high point said game mission particularly one focused vehicle section made memorable result way vehicle physic handled also really exhilarating see car explode vehicle explosion great since still enter car wrecked chasse found driving control responsive made game fun really understand need combat section shooting really boring wanted section done ai also felt extremely basic enemy stay place really seem move much making lot combat scenario much easier beyond also experienced handful bug time play many bug witnessed froze soft locked console ultimately forced reset would recommend game anyone probably love game time period even strong passion action may find something like driver take word grand theft auto san andreas came much stronger one much recommendable book,6.0,0.9967,Positive,0.32593333333333335,0.0,0.6421749999999999,0.8952,0.23103333333333334,0.2716,0.4215,-0.2294,,0.5636,,0.9612

Orwell: Ignorance is Strength,Osmotic Studios,Fellow Traveller,User,8.0,"There was a good amount of improvement to Ignorance is Strength over the original Orwell but there was a few instances where it took a step back as well. One thing I thought Orwell lacked that the sequel fixed was voice acting for the phone calls. It was not only a nice feature to add but the voice acting was well done. You can also now influence social media by finding data chunks that fit a certain narrative. The feature itself was decent but it kind of tied into one thing I didn’t like about Ignorance is Strength and that was the perspective. In the original you were doing ethically dubious deeds but were at least trying to find a bomber. In the sequel your objective felt far less worth the effort after the first chapter or so. One thing I will say is that I fully believe many governments would take part in the kind of petty actions that happen in this game. While I was a bit disappointed in where the story went I at least enjoyed the characters and the twists and turns they took as well as how the sequel tied into the original. It takes place at the same time as the original with you working on a totally separate case although it does overlap slightly. One more issue I had was that once again I found that the game didn’t stay true to what it asks of you. Your boss says to leave out data that doesn’t matter but at least a couple times I had to add, what I deem to be, subjective data chunks that were more opinion than fact in order to progress.

I played Ignorance is Strength on Linux. It never crashed and I didn’t notice any bugs or spelling mistakes. There are no graphics options. Alt-Tab didn’t work. The game saves on exit but there is just one save file so it always gets overwritten. The game is capped at 60 FPS.

Game Engine: Unity
Graphics API: OpenGL
Input Used: keyboard and mouse
Game Version Played: 1.1.6771.24898

CPU Usage: 4-19 
RAM Usage: 1.7-3.3 GB

Overall I would say that Ignorance is Strength is on par with the original Orwell. It does some things better, some things worse, so is overall a wash. If you enjoyed the original you should enjoy this sequel as it is very much the same style game play as before. The story and characters are worth exploring. My distaste for some of the story may really be praise if that is what the developers were going for. I finished the game in two hours and forty four minutes and can say it is worth it’s current price tag of 11.49 CAD.

Diablo,Blizzard Entertainment,Blizzard Entertainment,User,8.0,"(As for some reason Metacritic cannot rate PlayStation 1 version this is a review of PS1 version. Sorry!)

Couch-co-op dungeon crawling will always feel like magic.I’m not a big fan of hack  slash games, but I’ve always loved the first Diablo and playing it cooperatively on a single console. Strangely, you can play Diablo 1, 3, and 4 in couch co-op  but not Diablo 2. 

And for some reason, the PlayStation version of Diablo 1 has never been properly re-released. Which is a shame, because it’s a genuinely good ****, the interface is slow, and the framerate tanks when you open the map. And yes, you should ideally use a controller that emulates analog movement. 

But at its core, this is still the original Diablo: the horror, the atmosphere, the action built on top of proto-turn-based logic, the foundation of the **** PS1 version adds its own flavor: new visual effects, different pacing due to controller limitations, a unique co-op feel, and a quirky save system that lets you store your character and campaign separately (and exploit it if you want to).

It has aged, mostly in terms of technical quality and quality-of-life features. But in story, music, and raw gameplay feel, I still consider it the best version of Diablo  and, alongside a few PC mods, the most interesting way to experience the game today.","['reason', 'metacritic', 'rate', 'playstation', 'version', 'review', 'version', 'sorry', 'dungeon', 'crawling', 'always', 'feel', 'like', 'big', 'fan', 'hack', 'slash', 'game', 'always', 'loved', 'first', 'playing', 'cooperatively', 'single', 'console', 'strangely', 'play', 'couch', 'reason', 'playstation', 'version', 'never', 'properly', 'shame', 'genuinely', 'good', 'interface', 'slow', 'framerate', 'tank', 'open', 'map', 'yes', 'ideally', 'use', 'controller', 'emulates', 'analog', 'movement', 'core', 'still', 'original', 'horror', 'atmosphere', 'action', 'built', 'top', 'logic', 'foundation', 'version', 'add', 'flavor', 'new', 'visual', 'effect', 'different', 'pacing', 'due', 'controller', 'limitation', 'unique', 'feel', 'quirky', 'save', 'system', 'let', 'store', 'character', 'campaign', 'separately', 'exploit', 'want', 'aged', 'mostly', 'term', 'technical', 'quality', 'feature', 'story', 'music', 'raw', 'gameplay', 'feel', 'still', 'consider', 'best', 'version', 'alongside', 'pc', 'mod', 'interesting', 'way', 'experience', 'game', 'today']",reason metacritic rate playstation version review version sorry dungeon crawling always feel like big fan hack slash game always loved first playing cooperatively single console strangely play couch reason playstation version never properly shame genuinely good interface slow framerate tank open map yes ideally use controller emulates analog movement core still original horror atmosphere action built top logic foundation version add flavor new visual effect different pacing due controller limitation unique feel quirky save system let store character campaign separately exploit want aged mostly term technical quality feature story music raw gameplay feel still consider best version alongside pc mod interesting way experience game today,8.0,0.9839,Positive,0.87175,0.5164,0.8765,0.5811666666666667,0.8046666666666665,0.7735,0.27921999999999997,-0.0516,0.41245,0.5639666666666666,0.48256666666666664,

Diablo,Blizzard Entertainment,Blizzard Entertainment,User,9.0,"Diablo have been acknowledged for a long time as a pioneer game of the action role-playing genre, and more precisely, the hack and slash subgenre. 

Of course, the game is now almost 30 years old. He can not compete against modern games. But when you see Diablo through the lenses of the 90's, you understand how it came to be seen as a revolution in the role playing genre.

Every thing is already here, at an infant state. While turn-based role-playing games were standard during the 90's, Diablo came with a whole new gameplay, focused on instantaneous action. After 30 years, the gameplay has become rigid and limited, but for that time, it brought a sense of fluidity that had never been seen before in the role-playing genre.

Carrion,Phobia Game Studio,Devolver Digital,User,8.0,"Carrion is a great Metroidvania, with an unconventional protagonist and unique mechanics. The pixel art graphics are really cool, especially those of the protagonist. It follows the basic open-world formula, with back-and-forth progression based on new abilities acquired. The combat in Carrion is strategic: although you control a bizarre and large creature, it’s quite vulnerable to enemies, and often you need to rely on stealth and other 'means' (which I won't mention here to avoid spoiling the experience). The story isn’t anything groundbreaking in the sci-fi universe, but it’s interesting and revealed gradually through playable 'flashbacks.' There are some abilities the monster gains that are quite different from what you typically see in other games of the genre, making the experience more fun. The soundtrack has a mysterious tone, fitting well with the adventure’s atmosphere. All in all, Carrion is an intriguing game with a short duration (but sufficient), bringing new elements to the table, and I’d definitely recommend it to fans of the genre.","['great', 'metroidvania', 'unconventional', 'protagonist', 'unique', 'mechanic', 'pixel', 'art', 'graphic', 'really', 'cool', 'especially', 'protagonist', 'follows', 'basic', 'formula', 'progression', 'based', 'new', 'ability', 'acquired', 'combat', 'strategic', 'although', 'control', 'bizarre', 'large', 'creature', 'quite', 'vulnerable', 'enemy', 'often', 'need', 'rely', 'stealth', 'wo', 'mention', 'avoid', 'spoiling', 'experience', 'story', 'anything', 'groundbreaking', 'universe', 'interesting', 'revealed', 'gradually', 'playable', 'ability', 'monster', 'gain', 'quite', 'different', 'typically', 'see', 'game', 'genre', 'making', 'experience', 'fun', 'soundtrack', 'mysterious', 'tone', 'fitting', 'well', 'adventure', 'atmosphere', 'intriguing', 'game', 'short', 'duration', 'sufficient', 'bringing', 'new', 'element', 'table', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'fan', 'genre']",great metroidvania unconventional protagonist unique mechanic pixel art graphic really cool especially protagonist follows basic formula progression based new ability acquired combat strategic although control bizarre large creature quite vulnerable enemy often need rely stealth wo mention avoid spoiling experience story anything groundbreaking universe interesting revealed gradually playable ability monster gain quite different typically see game genre making experience fun soundtrack mysterious tone fitting well adventure atmosphere intriguing game short duration sufficient bringing new element table definitely recommend fan genre,8.0,0.9733,Positive,0.3612,0.37794,0.3804,-0.2102,0.06043333333333334,-0.6936,0.25,,0.245875,0.6369,,
Carrion,Phobia Game Studio,Devolver Digital,User,6.0,"Pretty cool and interesting game, but I wish they put a bit more thought into the level design. There were tons of moments for me getting soft locked where I needed to reload to my last autosave in order to properly progress. Then later on as you advance you start coming across levels you've did before, and if you mess up on something, say you accidentally triggered a laser you need to turn on in another room it can take forever to find how you turn it back on so you can sneak past to the now open door. The fighting/killing in this game was pretty clunky too, I wish they took a bit more time into polishing that. And I dont get why you cant eat soldiers when you can eat the other humans. You really think a massive flesh eating monster cares about one piece of armor?Overall the game in general just felt pretty repetitive too. Overtime you unlock more monster abilities but its all pretty same gameplay, with minor differences to how you progress past the map as your abilities are more for unlocking new map areas.

The Lord of the Rings - Gollum,Daedalic Entertainment,"Nacon, 3goo",User,1.0,"Now this is unplayable. It's not an over exaggeration, it's not review bombing, it's not forced online hate, it really is that bad. 
First and foremost, this game barely runs. The amount of frame dips, glitches, and load times I had playing this game is abysmal.
But even if the game did run well, it still ****. The concept itself is really where its conception should have ended. The idea of playing a game where you play as Gollum, the most useless and least powerful character in The Lord of the Rings, is truly baffling. How this got approved in the first place.
And the gameplay shows that the majority of what you do in Gollum is boring, trailing missions, climbing (Not just climbing, poorly optimized and bad climbing), and slow and boring stealth missions.
Now, there is a cool idea in this game. I find the concept of slowly choosing Gollum or Smeagol is a neat concept, and isn't inherently a bad one, it just doesn't seem to have a ton of impact on the true gameplay, so it's a bit worthless.

The game also looks awful. The environments are fine, but Gollum himself is one of the ugliest renderings of a character I have ever seen; they truly butchered his appearance.

Also, in most games, sound design is not something you bring up unless it's either really amazing or laughably bad.
This game's sound design was laughably bad. Every line delivery and it's audio placement feels off. Gollum game does this thing where it puts voicelines in one ear of your headphones, (Idk if that was just my headphones, I've heard it in online videos aswell, so I don't think it's just me).

UNDERWORLD ASCENDANT should be ashamed to use the name UNDERWORLD, as the ULTIMA UNDERWORLD games, being almost 30 years old created a far more believable and immersive underworld than this.
This is lazy programing: the game world consists out of a handful of levels which you will revisit over and over and over and over again to do quests - not given to you by NPCs, no, you just rip em off a board. The typical fetch x or kill x chores. The areas you revisit reset. Locked doors are locked again, enemies are back and puzzles need to be solved again.
The physics system is the most primitive thing they could get to work, it's also glitchy as hell. The art style is terrible - neon lights, bright colors, feels more like Tokyo than an Underworld. Then there's tons of bugs.

Ring of Pain,Twice Different,"Twice Different, Humble Games",Critic,80.0,Ring of Pain is interesting and enjoyable in ways that can keep you enthralled despite doing almost the exact same thing for hours. The quick runs are really nice for just jumping in and having a few goes rather than oversaturating yourself with this world. It nails the creepy aesthetic from the art and sound design right down to the way it plays.

Instead of relics that give passive abilities to synergize that need to be used strategically to get any benefit from.

A complicated puzzle with a lot of variety in-between runs and going for achievements can be quite fun or tedious no in-between.

Civ4 gives a sizable roster of buildings and units,many  of which have their own nice, such as seige Units which are good for weakening cities and collateral damage units which can strike a stack of units and do damage to a large amount of them. This was before they started going so strong on DLC meaning you could get away with just buying a Complete Edition with all the expansion packs and colonization. The game is made even better by mods, while officially you can only install 1 at a time in reality if 2 mods do not conflict you can combin, there is a JSON and Python interface for modding which makes it easy, I even tried when I was young to mod, the mods are what makes the game good and mods in this version are generally better than 5 (which some people consider skipped but I think is just now starting to go strong) or 6 (which generally grew pretty slow in the begining). With mods like Rye's and many many others this is a great modding experience, especially compared to the base game, large mods provide new depths tothe game and add the missing peices and add much more choice andmakes it require much more strategy and allows for bigger worlds and starting earlier (which I like as I prefer Middle ages and earlier history).

Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,Spark Unlimited,Codemasters,User,5.0,"Turning point fall of liberty is a game that tries way too hard to be action filled, but it doesn’t really do anything, and this is the mark entirely, I have a few major grips with turning point and one of them is the controls, the game isn’t that hard to beat. In fact it’s pretty easy even on the higher difficulty settings. The main issue is the controls are just so delayed. And it looks more like a PS2 game rather than a Xbox 360/PS3 game.

Credit or credit is due though the game does have a good backstory talking about what if Winston Churchill died in 1931 due to a car accident thus allowing the **** to win World War II, however, a good backstory alone doesn’t make a video game, the game tries way too hard to take itself seriously, but it ends up just being a buggy mess if anything this comes across as more funny rather than an action packed adventure,, I did find myself enjoying some of the gameplay however, mainly due to just seeing the crazy amount of bugs, such as a weapon flying right off the screen, as soon as the enemy is killed for no rhyme or reason, One of the major sins this game commits is it kills off the main character roughly around 2 to 3 hours into the game, I understand this game was made on a very short timesheet, but if it had spent another six months to a year in the oven, it would’ve been much better.

However, despite all the negativity, I’m saying about this game, if you could find it for around 5, I recommend picking it up just to see all the hilarious bugs that can come out of it, I expect no I need games that focus on a World War II setting to do better, at least they try to make it interesting but Wolfenstein this is not.

I’m giving turning point fall of liberty 4.8/10 stars, if you’re looking for a captivating story in an alternate World War II setting look elsewhere, if you’re looking for a game that just doesn’t care and just shows off hilarious bugs and glitches then this is the game for you.","['game', 'try', 'way', 'hard', 'action', 'filled', 'really', 'anything', 'mark', 'entirely', 'major', 'grip', 'one', 'control', 'game', 'hard', 'beat', 'fact', 'pretty', 'easy', 'even', 'higher', 'difficulty', 'setting', 'main', 'issue', 'control', 'delayed', 'look', 'like', 'game', 'rather', 'xbox', 'game', 'credit', 'credit', 'due', 'though', 'game', 'good', 'backstory', 'talking', 'winston', 'churchill', 'died', 'due', 'car', 'accident', 'thus', 'allowing', 'win', 'world', 'war', 'ii', 'however', 'good', 'backstory', 'alone', 'make', 'video', 'game', 'game', 'try', 'way', 'hard', 'take', 'seriously', 'end', 'buggy', 'mess', 'anything', 'come', 'across', 'funny', 'rather', 'action', 'packed', 'adventure', 'find', 'enjoying', 'gameplay', 'however', 'mainly', 'due', 'seeing', 'crazy', 'amount', 'bug', 'weapon', 'flying', 'right', 'screen', 'soon', 'enemy', 'killed', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'one', 'major', 'sin', 'game', 'commits', 'kill', 'main', 'character', 'roughly', 'around', 'hour', 'game', 'understand', 'game', 'made', 'short', 'timesheet', 'spent', 'another', 'six', 'month', 'year', 'oven', 'would', 'much', 'better', 'however', 'despite', 'negativity', 'saying', 'game', 'could', 'find', 'around', 'recommend', 'picking', 'see', 'hilarious', 'bug', 'come', 'expect', 'need', 'game', 'focus', 'world', 'war', 'ii', 'setting', 'better', 'least', 'try', 'make', 'interesting', 'wolfenstein', 'giving', 'star', 'looking', 'captivating', 'story', 'alternate', 'world', 'war', 'ii', 'setting', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'looking', 'game', 'care', 'show', 'hilarious', 'bug', 'glitch', 'game']",game try way hard action filled really anything mark entirely major grip one control game hard beat fact pretty easy even higher difficulty setting main issue control delayed look like game rather xbox game credit credit due though game good backstory talking winston churchill died due car accident thus allowing win world war ii however good backstory alone make video game game try way hard take seriously end buggy mess anything come across funny rather action packed adventure find enjoying gameplay however mainly due seeing crazy amount bug weapon flying right screen soon enemy killed rhyme reason one major sin game commits kill main character roughly around hour game understand game made short timesheet spent another six month year oven would much better however despite negativity saying game could find around recommend picking see hilarious bug come expect need game focus world war ii setting better least try make interesting wolfenstein giving star looking captivating story alternate world war ii setting look elsewhere looking game care show hilarious bug glitch game,5.0,0.9485,Positive,-0.03025,0.23735,,,-0.9539,-0.1283,-0.1633333333333333,0.1960666666666667,0.3612,-0.9539,,

Fallout 3,Bethesda Game Studios,Bethesda Softworks,User,7.0,"OVERVIEW: Fallout 3 is one of the best entries to the Fallout series of games and a good RPG to lose yourself in the world of. What the game lacks in technical game design and innovative gameplay, it makes up for with an large, freeing world and charm.

GAMEPLAY: 7/10 - The core gameplay of Fallout 3 is very simple and easy to understand. The game gives you a lot of freedom with these basic mechanics however, meaning you can squeeze plenty of hours of messing around out of the game. There is a decent amount of jank to the game but this is to be expected and arguably adds to the experience when funny things happen in the game.

STORY: 6/10 - The main story in Fallout 3 is fine, but doesn't do much to go beyond that. The stakes feel very low most of the time due to the aforementioned 'charm' that Bethesda's characters have, even the villains of the world. In addition to this, the story just simply isn't that interesting. On the other hand, most players likely aren't going to be playing this game in hopes of a beautiful and inspiring story, and for that reason the story is passable in this context.  

SOUNDTRACK: 9/10 - While I am doubtful that many players are coming to Fallout 3 specifically for any of it's original pieces, it's soundtrack is very enjoyable to listen to via the radio while you explore the wasteland and loot settlements. All of the songs chosen fit the same vibe and are a blast to listen to.

CHARACTERS: 7/10 - The characters that you meet in Fallout 3 all for the most part have the loveable 'Bethesda' charm that most players have come to expect from the developers. While most of them aren't particularly fleshed out, they work in the context of the game and are fun to communicate with. 

GRAPHICS/VISUALS: 6/10 - Fallout 3 is an old game (2008) so obviously will look worse than a modern game, however I think the intentionally bleakness and realism of the game from the time hides this a lot worse than a lot of other games from a similar era that simply hold up better (and looked better at the time). Graphics aren't everything but this game definitely is far from a visual masterpiece.

CUTSCENES: 7/10 - While there isn't many cutscenes in Fallout 3, the few that are present are perfectly serviceable and get the point they need to across.

Overall, Fallout 3 is a very enjoyable game and while it isn't the best game technically, it is more than worth picking up and playing. There is a certain charm only contained within Bethesda games that players yearn for, and this game along with Oblivion and Skyrim are great ways to get that experience.","['overview', 'one', 'best', 'entry', 'series', 'game', 'good', 'rpg', 'lose', 'world', 'game', 'lack', 'technical', 'game', 'design', 'innovative', 'gameplay', 'make', 'large', 'freeing', 'world', 'charm', 'gameplay', 'core', 'gameplay', 'simple', 'easy', 'understand', 'game', 'give', 'lot', 'freedom', 'basic', 'mechanic', 'however', 'meaning', 'squeeze', 'plenty', 'hour', 'messing', 'around', 'game', 'decent', 'amount', 'jank', 'game', 'expected', 'arguably', 'add', 'experience', 'funny', 'thing', 'happen', 'game', 'story', 'main', 'story', 'fine', 'much', 'go', 'beyond', 'stake', 'feel', 'low', 'time', 'due', 'aforementioned', 'bethesda', 'character', 'even', 'villain', 'world', 'addition', 'story', 'simply', 'interesting', 'hand', 'player', 'likely', 'going', 'playing', 'game', 'hope', 'beautiful', 'inspiring', 'story', 'reason', 'story', 'passable', 'context', 'soundtrack', 'doubtful', 'many', 'player', 'coming', 'specifically', 'original', 'piece', 'soundtrack', 'enjoyable', 'listen', 'via', 'radio', 'explore', 'wasteland', 'loot', 'settlement', 'song', 'chosen', 'fit', 'vibe', 'blast', 'listen', 'character', 'character', 'meet', 'part', 'loveable', 'charm', 'player', 'come', 'expect', 'developer', 'particularly', 'fleshed', 'work', 'context', 'game', 'fun', 'communicate', 'old', 'game', 'obviously', 'look', 'worse', 'modern', 'game', 'however', 'think', 'intentionally', 'bleakness', 'realism', 'game', 'time', 'hide', 'lot', 'worse', 'lot', 'game', 'similar', 'era', 'simply', 'hold', 'better', 'looked', 'better', 'time', 'graphic', 'everything', 'game', 'definitely', 'far', 'visual', 'masterpiece', 'cutscenes', 'many', 'cutscenes', 'present', 'perfectly', 'serviceable', 'get', 'point', 'need', 'across', 'overall', 'enjoyable', 'game', 'best', 'game', 'technically', 'worth', 'picking', 'playing', 'certain', 'charm', 'contained', 'within', 'bethesda', 'game', 'player', 'yearn', 'game', 'along', 'oblivion', 'skyrim', 'great', 'way', 'get', 'experience']",overview one best entry series game good rpg lose world game lack technical game design innovative gameplay make large freeing world charm gameplay core gameplay simple easy understand game give lot freedom basic mechanic however meaning squeeze plenty hour messing around game decent amount jank game expected arguably add experience funny thing happen game story main story fine much go beyond stake feel low time due aforementioned bethesda character even villain world addition story simply interesting hand player likely going playing game hope beautiful inspiring story reason story passable context soundtrack doubtful many player coming specifically original piece soundtrack enjoyable listen via radio explore wasteland loot settlement song chosen fit vibe blast listen character character meet part loveable charm player come expect developer particularly fleshed work context game fun communicate old game obviously look worse modern game however think intentionally bleakness realism game time hide lot worse lot game similar era simply hold better looked better time graphic everything game definitely far visual masterpiece cutscenes many cutscenes present perfectly serviceable get point need across overall enjoyable game best game technically worth picking playing certain charm contained within bethesda game player yearn game along oblivion skyrim great way get experience,7.0,0.9975,Positive,0.38818,0.27772499999999994,0.38,0.30473999999999996,0.606775,,0.6010666666666666,,,0.3999,,0.5822

Fray (2012),Brain Candy,Brain Candy,User,2.0,"Very disappointed.

I purchased this title with great enthusiasm; the trailer was sharp, and the concept seemed sound/innovative. However, I had this sinking feeling things were going to take a turn   for the worse very quickly once I got my game. Upon launching the game it failed to let me click on the button for registration. Once I got the registration done by manually logging into their site, the client locked up while trying to download my 'Characters' which I had not created yet. That is an issue that has existed for over a month; related to their database provider underestimating the needs of the game (which are still obviously underestimated).

Then I finally get in after retrying 6-8 times, only to find out that I cannot play a two player game, and that we have to wait until four are ready to play. The fourth didn't show up in the twenty mins that I waited DURING the Steam summer sale; only a total of 17 people were online and playing the game during what is likely to be the hottest time for the game since release day.

What looks great in the trailers is a dog in the kennel. The game should have local servers, the game should support 32-bit Win7, the game should, the game should, the game should...a lot of should's and not enough do's in my opinion.

It’s clearly a tune inspired by other survival-horror classics, but it has its own unique tempo and melody. And it’s a darkly catchy one, to boot.

Song of Horror,Protocol Games,Raiser Games,User,9.0,"Song of Horror is an unnerving, old-school singleplayer horror game, sharing qualities with blockbusters such as Resident Evil and Silent Hill.
The story begins with the disappearance of the acclaimed writer Sebastian P. Husher, causing an array of characters to investigate his disappearance. Each character has their own background, and although the death of your character does not mean game over, it does require the player to switch to a different character. However, the player may wish to retrieve their previous character’s items, requiring them to undergo a similar journey to the one that killed them initially, unsettling the player through re-experiencing a similar journey to what caused their death. If all characters die, some players find it frustrating to have to restart an entire episode after one final small mistake, but in my opinion, the steep learning curve just adds to the reality of the dangers in this game - one moment of shock does not compare to the hours of dread that come while the player is exploring Song of Horror’s environments.
The main antagonist of Song of Horror is The Presence, a powerful entity that constantly shadows the protagonist, learning the way the player approaches the game and adapting to their playing style – rather than being a single monster, The Presence acts an adaptive tracker that exploits the player through their weaknesses instead of relying on brute force; the game is absent of any combat mechanics and instead puts more emphasis on escaping any threats, almost all of which are entirely unpredictable, invoking a certain element of tension. No two encounters with The Presence seem the same, helping with the game’s replay-ability.
The disturbing atmosphere, formed particularly by the intricate sound design and music, contribute to the game being ideal for almost all horror seekers. Despite this, it must be noted that the visual graphics are nothing exceptional, clearly targeting an audience more familiar with a classic, minimalistic side of horror. Hence, I’d argue that the game is more enjoyable for old school players, and certain mechanics such as fixed camera angles and slow pacing continue to divide players’ opinions. Bugs in Song of Horror are rare, but if I had to make a criticism about the game’s quality, I’d consider mentioning the occasional frame rate drops.
Overall, Song of Horror succeeds as a chilling tribute to classic survival horror, masterfully blending atmosphere, lore, and gameplay. Its tense exploration and ominous soundscape create an experience few modern horror titles achieve. While the visuals are modest and the pacing deliberate, these choices reinforce its classical charm. The game offers up to 50 hours of playtime, impressively thought-provoking puzzles, and a rare balance between story depth and mechanical challenge. At around 30 for the complete edition, it delivers excellent value for players seeking a truly disturbing and rewarding horror experience.","['unnerving', 'singleplayer', 'game', 'sharing', 'quality', 'blockbuster', 'resident', 'evil', 'silent', 'hill', 'story', 'begin', 'disappearance', 'acclaimed', 'writer', 'sebastian', 'husher', 'causing', 'array', 'character', 'investigate', 'disappearance', 'character', 'background', 'although', 'death', 'character', 'mean', 'game', 'require', 'player', 'switch', 'different', 'character', 'however', 'player', 'may', 'wish', 'retrieve', 'previous', 'character', 'item', 'requiring', 'undergo', 'similar', 'journey', 'one', 'killed', 'initially', 'unsettling', 'player', 'similar', 'journey', 'caused', 'death', 'character', 'die', 'player', 'find', 'frustrating', 'restart', 'entire', 'episode', 'one', 'final', 'small', 'mistake', 'opinion', 'steep', 'learning', 'curve', 'add', 'reality', 'danger', 'game', 'one', 'moment', 'shock', 'compare', 'hour', 'dread', 'come', 'player', 'exploring', 'environment', 'main', 'antagonist', 'presence', 'powerful', 'entity', 'constantly', 'shadow', 'protagonist', 'learning', 'way', 'player', 'approach', 'game', 'adapting', 'playing', 'style', 'rather', 'single', 'monster', 'presence', 'act', 'adaptive', 'tracker', 'exploit', 'player', 'weakness', 'instead', 'relying', 'brute', 'force', 'game', 'absent', 'combat', 'mechanic', 'instead', 'put', 'emphasis', 'escaping', 'threat', 'almost', 'entirely', 'unpredictable', 'invoking', 'certain', 'element', 'tension', 'two', 'encounter', 'presence', 'seem', 'helping', 'game', 'disturbing', 'atmosphere', 'formed', 'particularly', 'intricate', 'sound', 'design', 'music', 'contribute', 'game', 'ideal', 'almost', 'seeker', 'despite', 'must', 'noted', 'visual', 'graphic', 'nothing', 'exceptional', 'clearly', 'targeting', 'audience', 'familiar', 'classic', 'minimalistic', 'side', 'hence', 'argue', 'game', 'enjoyable', 'old', 'school', 'player', 'certain', 'mechanic', 'fixed', 'camera', 'angle', 'slow', 'pacing', 'continue', 'divide', 'player', 'opinion', 'bug', 'rare', 'make', 'criticism', 'game', 'quality', 'consider', 'mentioning', 'occasional', 'frame', 'rate', 'drop', 'overall', 'succeeds', 'chilling', 'tribute', 'classic', 'survival', 'masterfully', 'blending', 'atmosphere', 'lore', 'gameplay', 'tense', 'exploration', 'ominous', 'soundscape', 'create', 'experience', 'modern', 'title', 'achieve', 'visuals', 'modest', 'pacing', 'deliberate', 'choice', 'reinforce', 'classical', 'charm', 'game', 'offer', 'hour', 'playtime', 'impressively', 'puzzle', 'rare', 'balance', 'story', 'depth', 'mechanical', 'challenge', 'around', 'complete', 'edition', 'delivers', 'excellent', 'value', 'player', 'seeking', 'truly', 'disturbing', 'rewarding', 'experience']",unnerving singleplayer game sharing quality blockbuster resident evil silent hill story begin disappearance acclaimed writer sebastian husher causing array character investigate disappearance character background although death character mean game require player switch different character however player may wish retrieve previous character item requiring undergo similar journey one killed initially unsettling player similar journey caused death character die player find frustrating restart entire episode one final small mistake opinion steep learning curve add reality danger game one moment shock compare hour dread come player exploring environment main antagonist presence powerful entity constantly shadow protagonist learning way player approach game adapting playing style rather single monster presence act adaptive tracker exploit player weakness instead relying brute force game absent combat mechanic instead put emphasis escaping threat almost entirely unpredictable invoking certain element tension two encounter presence seem helping game disturbing atmosphere formed particularly intricate sound design music contribute game ideal almost seeker despite must noted visual graphic nothing exceptional clearly targeting audience familiar classic minimalistic side hence argue game enjoyable old school player certain mechanic fixed camera angle slow pacing continue divide player opinion bug rare make criticism game quality consider mentioning occasional frame rate drop overall succeeds chilling tribute classic survival masterfully blending atmosphere lore gameplay tense exploration ominous soundscape create experience modern title achieve visuals modest pacing deliberate choice reinforce classical charm game offer hour playtime impressively puzzle rare balance story depth mechanical challenge around complete edition delivers excellent value player seeking truly disturbing rewarding experience,9.0,0.1864,Positive,0.39530000000000004,-0.30019999999999997,-0.11771666666666665,0.007075000000000022,0.13326666666666667,0.21955,-0.13944999999999996,-0.5574,-0.6855500000000001,-0.04464999999999999,-0.3489,0.8625

Slain!,Wolf Brew Games,Digerati Distribution,User,6.0,"Slain is a rare success story in the sense that it released in horrific condition and instead of washing their hands of it and cashing what little money they made from it the devs actually fixed it, and so we have Slain: Back from Hell which is basically version 2.0 and it fixes most of the issues that plagued initial release build, which is reflected in the recent (very positive) and overall (mixed) scores in the Steam user reviews section.

I'd like to start off by saying Slain is hard, almost frustratingly so at times so you're going to die, a lot. Going into the game I didn't quite understand how challenging it was meant to be so it was quite the shock. Just for reference I have finished Bloodborne, the Dark Souls series and Salt  Sanctuary so I'm no stranger to hard games but Slain had a way of making me feel like it was being unnecessarily hard or even cheap just for the sake of it at times, however for the most part the game was a solid, enjoyable challenge, it's just a shame the overall experience was tarnished a little due to a few rare outliers that left me saying to myself 'Really?.....', for example certain mobs have brutally tight timings on their counter attack, and when you have to hit multiple of them in a row without taking a single hit it can be frustrating, and it was. I also found myself begging to the Metal Gods themselves for a checkpoint at times after a tough section or mob but was left wanting which again caused frustration when I died and had to do it all again. I'd like to make it clear though, for the most part this isn't an issue, but these blips really did hurt my enjoyment of the game and I think Slain would benefit greatly from a final tuning phase.

Difficulty aside the game is tight for the most part, but I did run into a couple of issues where my attacks would pass through enemies, most notably on the final boss, I also had an issue where the charge up attack would sometimes cancel before the *ching* even though I was holding down the button still, it didn't happen a lot but enough to become very frustrating, especially as it often meant death when it occurred. Other than those issues the gameplay is good, the controls feel responsive and the combat is enjoyable, I would highly recommend using the D-Pad over the thumb sticks, though, as it was far more accurate IMO.

Technically I had no issues, I played the game on a GTX 970 / 3570k  4.3GHz and it ran at a solid 60fps throughout on maximum settings which is what you'd expect, but it's not always the case sadly so I thought I'd mention it. Visually the game is great and I say that as someone who isn't a big fan of pixel/retro style graphics but in Slain's case they worked and were executed well. To go with the smart visuals we also have a solid metal soundtrack which is a core part of the game and theme, so it was crucial that it was good and it is.

Overall I do recommend the game but only if you enjoy challenging games, if you go into Slain expecting to He-man your way through everything you'll be sorely disappointed, you never feel particularly powerful and you're always one wrong button press away from death so it's quite stressful, but if this sort of adrenaline rush is what you enjoy then I'm sure you'll have a blast with Slain: Back from Hell.","['rare', 'success', 'story', 'sense', 'released', 'horrific', 'condition', 'instead', 'washing', 'hand', 'cashing', 'little', 'money', 'made', 'devs', 'actually', 'fixed', 'back', 'hell',

Thoughts-
Overall, Loopmancer gets enough right to be a compelling package for some rogue-like enthusiasts, particularly those that devour everything the genre spits out. The action is fun and varied and the levels mix things up just enough to make replaying them avoid feeling like a slog most of the time. Had the levels felt more fundamentally different in subsequent runs or the designs of each stage been more consistently unique from one another, that could have really made me forget about the story, setting, and characters being almost impossible to care about. But as it is, it feels more like a good rogue-like that just holds itself back a bit and ultimately doesn’t quite stand toe-to-toe with the scads of better examples of the genre we’ve gotten over the last few years.","['level', 'gorgeous', 'combat', 'decently', 'varied', 'fun', 'forgettable', 'story', 'setting', 'character', 'generic', 'music', 'level', 'inconsistent', 'redundant', 'enemy', 'type', 'overall', 'get', 'enough', 'right', 'compelling', 'package', 'enthusiast', 'particularly', 'devour', 'everything', 'genre', 'spit', 'action', 'fun', 'varied', 'level', 'mix', 'thing', 'enough', 'make', 'replaying', 'avoid', 'feeling', 'like', 'slog', 'time', 'level', 'felt', 'fundamentally', 'different', 'subsequent', 'run', 'design', 'stage', 'consistently', 'unique', 'one', 'another', 'could', 'really', 'made', 'forget', 'story', 'setting', 'character', 'almost', 'impossible', 'care', 'feel', 'like', 'good', 'hold', 'back', 'bit', 'ultimately', 'quite', 'stand', 'scad', 'better', 'example', 'genre', 'gotten', 'last', 'year']",level gorgeous combat decently varied fun forgettable story setting character generic music level inconsistent redundant enemy type overall get enough right compelling package enthusiast particularly devour everything genre spit action fun varied level mix thing enough make replaying avoid feeling like slog time level felt fundamentally different subsequent run design stage consistently unique one another could really made forget story setting character almost impossible care feel like good hold back bit ultimately quite stand scad better example genre gotten last year,6.0,0.9481,Positive,0.072,0.072,0.5106,0.21807500000000002,-0.0516,,0.5106,,0.9154,0.40125,,

Crysis,Crytek,"EA Games, Electronic Arts",User,6.0,"Crysis, a game that still looks better than many modern titles, offers an open-world-like experience where the player is mostly left to explore and act freely.Unlike most other FPS games, Crysis gives you a special suit with various abilities that shape how you play the game. However, in my opinion, these abilities are not well balanced. You can easily complete the game by relying on just one  mostly stealth. You can literally finish the game by staying in bushes and using the cloaking ability. Although strength mode is needed in a few spots, it's rarely essential. This feels like poor design to **** enemy AI breaks down in some areas. The power balance is inconsistent  the same enemy can feel incredibly strong at times, and ridiculously weak at others. Weapon designs are nice, but the shooting feedback is almost non-existent. Sometimes, bullets don’t even register on enemies, which is **** story manages to spark curiosity, keeping the player engaged. The Turkish voice acting is a pleasant bonus and adds flavor to the experience. However, the missions start to repeat after a while, which can become tiresome. Mission design is average, though the variety in objectives is actually pretty good.Occasionally, you run into strange bugs. But when it comes to graphics  there's no need to explain. They're absolutely stunning, even by today's standards. On the downside, the characters lack depth and memorability. I've already forgotten half their names. The ending feels like a traditional boss fight **** the end, despite its flaws, Crysis succeeded in making me feel nostalgic and happy.

I ended up hooking up a keyboard and mouse and while yes it plays a lot better, it does not fix the bad framerate. The more people and explosions the worse it gets and nothing it worse than knowing you are aiming and shooting at an enemy but because of frame drops you just miss all your shots.Aside from that the game has some special PS2 only maps and has character portraits for the characters.

Brigade E5: New Jagged Union,Apeiron,"Strategy First, 1C Entertainment",User,5.0,"I'm not even sure if anyone is going to read this, since the last post was 2007, but I wanted to add my 2 cents.  This game should have no relation to JA series.  It should be its own franchise (see JA: Back in Action).  None of the characters from JA or JA2 are in BE5, and you aren't even working for AIM.  NPC interactions are a joke, I stopped caring about the storyline pretty early in the game because talking to NPCs was not enjoyable (translation not very good, no emotion in the characters, not personable).  As for the storyline, I was disappointed as well.  There are 3 factions, each don't like each other.  If you do missions for one, you will lose your status with the other(s).  Although, it really doesn't matter who you take your missions from, because all of the missions are pretty much the same among the factions, with tiny changes.  Mostly deliver a package, then assassinate someone, then retake a city, etc.  All of that being said, the game does have some positives.  If you aren't concerned with storyline and want to go around blowing everything up, this can be the game for you.  The weapon selection is pretty good; you can even select different ammo types for your weapons (FMJ, JHP, etc).  The RPG even has anti personnel rounds and anti armor rounds, even though you won't need to knock out tanks or other vehicles.  There are many attachments for every weapon as well.  You can deck it out for night ops with night vision devices (NATO and WP equipment), or go with CQB setup like red dot sight, or for long range (sniper scopes, ACOG, etc).  You can carry almost every version of M16 series or AK series.  Grenades, trip wires, land mines, body armor, the works.  Combat is pretty neat as it is all in real time, although you can pause the action to make your moves.  Although not exactly realistic, it does give you a chance to make decisions for your mercs (which won't do anything without your involvement).  I think this option is imperative for any game where the characters can't do some basic things for themselves (like defend themselves).  I would have liked to see more squad tactics, such as being able to move in tactical formations such as wedge, line, column, file, etc.  You won't have too much trouble with the bad guys for the most part.  They aren't very good at tactics, although I have been snuck up on occasionally (always have someone guarding your 6).  They aren't afraid to use grenades, and they usually carry some hefty firepower.  You can enter some buildings and go to multistories, shooting out of windows or off rooftops, but be careful doing so.  Launching rockets from the roof can be dangerous, because the rocket usually hits the roof ledge and explodes on contact, killing anyone unlucky enough to be standing next to the shooter.  This also goes with shooting from the roof; your merc will continue to blast into the roof ledge, with none of the bullets going to the intended target.  But it is fun to lob grenades from the roof on unsuspecting bad guys.  After all of that, I like this game.  Not for the storyline or interactions (JA2 was so awesome with that), but for the chance to go around causing mayhem.  I know this is a good game because I find myself pulling it off the shelf and reinstalling it, just to play the combat.","['even', 'sure', 'anyone', 'going', 'read', 'since', 'last', 'post', 'wanted', 'add', 'cent', 'game', 'relation', 'ja', 'series', 'franchise', 'see', 'ja', 'back', 'action', 'none', 'character', 'ja', 'even', 'working', 'aim', 'npc', 'interaction', 'joke', 'stopped', 'caring', 'storyline', 'pretty', 'early', 'game', 'talking', 'npc', 'enjoyable', 'translation', 'good', 'emotion', 'character', 'personable', 'storyline', 'disappointed', 'well', 'faction', 'like', 'mission', 'one', 'lose', 'status', 'although', 'really', 'matter', 'take', 'mission', 'mission', 'pretty', 'much', 'among', 'faction', 'tiny', 'change', 'mostly', 'deliver', 'package', 'assassinate', 'someone', 'retake', 'city', 'etc', 'said', 'game', 'positive', 'concerned', 'storyline', 'want', 'go', 'around', 'blowing', 'everything', 'game', 'weapon', 'selection', 'pretty', 'good', 'even', 'select', 'different', 'ammo', 'type', 'weapon', 'fmj', 'jhp', 'etc', 'rpg', 'even', 'anti', 'personnel', 'round', 'anti', 'armor', 'round', 'even', 'though', 'wo', 'need', 'knock', 'tank', 'vehicle', 'many', 'attachment', 'every', 'weapon', 'well', 'deck', 'night', 'ops', 'night', 'vision', 'device', 'nato', 'wp', 'equipment', 'go', 'cqb', 'setup', 'like', 'red', 'dot', 'sight', 'long', 'range', 'sniper', 'scope', 'acog', 'etc', 'carry', 'almost', 'every', 'version', 'series', 'ak', 'series', 'grenade', 'trip', 'wire', 'land', 'mine', 'body', 'armor', 'work', 'combat', 'pretty', 'neat', 'real', 'time', 'although', 'pause', 'action', 'make', 'move', 'although', 'exactly', 'realistic', 'give', 'chance', 'make', 'decision', 'mercs', 'wo', 'anything', 'without', 'involvement', 'think', 'option', 'imperative', 'game', 'character', 'ca', 'basic', 'thing', 'like', 'defend', 'would', 'liked', 'see', 'squad', 'tactic', 'able', 'move', 'tactical', 'formation', 'wedge', 'line', 'column', 'file', 'etc', 'wo', 'much', 'trouble', 'bad', 'guy', 'part', 'good', 'tactic', 'although', 'snuck', 'occasionally', 'always', 'someone', 'guarding', 'afraid', 'use', 'grenade', 'usually', 'carry', 'hefty', 'firepower', 'enter', 'building', 'go', 'multistories', 'shooting', 'window', 'rooftop', 'careful', 'launching', 'rocket', 'roof', 'dangerous', 'rocket', 'usually', 'hit', 'roof', 'ledge', 'explodes', 'contact', 'killing', 'anyone', 'unlucky', 'enough', 'standing', 'next', 'shooter', 'also', 'go', 'shooting', 'roof', 'merc', 'continue', 'blast', 'roof', 'ledge', 'none', 'bullet', 'going', 'intended', 'target', 'fun', 'lob', 'grenade', 'roof', 'unsuspecting', 'bad', 'guy', 'like', 'game', 'storyline', 'interaction', 'awesome', 'chance', 'go', 'around', 'causing', 'mayhem', 'know', 'good', 'game', 'find', 'pulling', 'shelf', 'reinstalling', 'play', 'combat']",even sure anyone going read since last post wanted add cent game relation ja series franchise see ja back action none character ja even working aim npc interaction joke stopped caring storyline pretty early game talking npc enjoyable translation good emotion character personable storyline disappointed well faction like mission one lose status although really matter take mission mission pretty much among faction tiny change mostly deliver package assassinate someone retake city etc said game positive concerned storyline want go around blowing everything game weapon selection pretty good even select different ammo type weapon fmj jhp etc rpg even anti personnel round anti armor round even though wo need knock tank vehicle many attachment every weapon well deck night ops night vision device nato wp equipment go cqb setup like red dot sight long range sniper scope acog etc carry almost every version series ak series grenade trip wire land mine body armor work combat pretty neat real time although pause action make move although exactly realistic give chance make decision mercs wo anything without involvement think option imperative game character ca basic thing like defend would liked see squad tactic able move tactical formation wedge line column file etc wo much trouble bad guy part good tactic although snuck occasionally always someone guarding afraid use grenade usually carry hefty firepower enter building go multistories shooting window rooftop careful launching rocket roof dangerous rocket usually hit roof ledge explodes contact killing anyone unlucky enough standing next shooter also go shooting roof merc continue blast roof ledge none bullet going intended target fun lob grenade roof unsuspecting bad guy like game storyline interaction awesome chance go around causing mayhem know good game find pulling shelf reinstalling play combat,5.0,-0.9089,Negative,0.22119999999999998,0.093675,-0.7351,-0.12165999999999999,0.25582000000000005,0.0,0.3347,,0.32136666666666663,0.16693333333333335,,

First, I like the art style. It may not be to everybody's taste but you can see that a lot of effort has been put into the art. It's  colourful, pretty unique and more importantly it fits perfectly with the general cartoonish atmosphere of the game. I really liked the fact that this game does not take itself seriously.
You punch fratboys, you spank bankers, you punish corrupt cops and more generally you bring justice to white collar criminals.There again, it might not be for everyone's taste but personally, I really appreciated this effort. It's not so often that we have a game who is tongue-in-cheek and not afraid to be politically incorrect. It was especially true for the ending of the game which really  surprised me and reminded me of a silly version of Streets of Rage.

Apart from that its a pretty standard beat'em up with a lot of action and some effort to make the levels as varied as possible. Good thing is, you can play in co-op with a friend on the same screen and use some pretty funny collaborative attacks.

Balan Wonderworld,"Balan Company, Arzest",Square Enix,User,,"Alright, so I wanna make this VERY clear.... The 10 ratings are by users with well... Only one review to their account. I don't use review sites outside of reference but because either devs or bots want to make this seem like a wrongfully hated game... I gotta do my part in giving it a 0. Realistically it's a 1. Read below as for why:


They spent all the budget on the cutscenes... No for real though the cutscenes resemble end of service ps3 era anime like graghics but when you play the **** boy! It lookslike a horrible GameCube tech demo. The game runs like ****, I'm talking 15-45ish frames with background objects going even worse. Play it on modern Gen hardware? It's more consistently 50 or so frames but that's not a complement. This is bad game engine optimization. Game looks like outdated no budget trash. On a very powerful system.... It should have zero lag. This is incompetence. Now allow me to lecture you the story... Drugs. No, no, I mean it has no narrative. No dialog other than balan ego stroking. There's literally nothing here man. It's a vacant story with bad cutscenes that look like they were pitched by a middleschooler. Npcs? Why are they HUGE? Why does everyone dance? Soundtrack is also incredibly mediocre it isn't great. Stop it. Npcs don't fade out they just pop out. Anytime you're close poof gone. Vanished. Now let's talk sound design... Not great. Hey, ho, whaho. That's the jump sounds. They get old... FAST. balan is literally Cappy but without any charm. He has horibble, as others put it copy and paste QTE sequences because yeah.... They're the same. Every. Single. Time. Trophies of balan... Look the exact same and they insist on showing you a big pop-up screen every time you get one. Why? Next let's talk about damage... You'll get hurt by moving objects that don't even crush or squeeze you or fall onto you. Yeah just touching them is enough to get an ouchie.

The big part... Power ups.
I wanted to save this one for later, so you can hold like 3 to start the game... And that should tell you puzzles will be simple. Here's why... Some powers are simple as a jump. Spin jump. Yoshi jump. Bubble jump. Slam jump. Jump with electricity and can swim verrrrry sloooooow, dolphin can swim faster. Some powers can't even jump. It's Mario you jump on heads and they die. Bosses  3 hit kill. Bosses lack any depth whatsoever it's just hit a projectile and then they loop an animation and throw more stuff for you to throw back at them. Literally sonic the hedgehog had more depth than this. F*** it even bubsy had better bosses. Even Alex Kidd. Alright I'm gonna a make this blatant as possible the game fricken ****.



The endgame...
Chao gar... Sorry, I meant TiMs garden. You find droplets scattered across every level and mini game, you can throw them at color coded flower fields in the overworld hub.... Because you totally need colored flowers to drop colored droplets... And basically they glitch out like crazy and TiMs follow you around making weird mentally challenged Pokémon like noises. Why do they follow you? Who knows. But theydo automated tasks and it makes a ticker go up and at different numbers you unlock more stuff for your TiMs to like play or whatever... This doesn't do crap for you btw. Oh yeah you can breed them... How? Just throw the small Tim at the big Tim... Yikes.","['alright', 'wan', 'na', 'make', 'clear', 'rating', 'user', 'well', 'one', 'review', 'account', 'use', 'review', 'site', 'outside', 'reference', 'either', 'devs', 'bot', 'want', 'make',

Slain: Back from Hell,Wolf Brew Games,"Wolf Brew Games, CrossFunction, Digerati Distribution, Merge Games",User,10.0,"Much better than the average score would have you believe. This is a 2D Castlevania-like hack-n-slash, but it is linear like the early Castlevania games (not a 'Metroidvania'). The look and combat mechanics are similar to other PS4 games like Dead Cells and Blasphemous, but i honestly like this one the best. It's gorgeous, bloody and metal as all hell. The best part for me is the addictive gameplay. Each level has many save points, between the save points feels like a mini-level that you will probably die in the first time. You respawn quickly and with your knowledge of the traps and enemies you try again, maybe with a different approach, maybe you die again but now you might have a different idea for how to approach it the next play through. This is fun in a Hotline Miami or Super Meat Boy way, but may be it is hard to explain if you've never played those games. It might sound frustrating, and it can be, but it is also fun, engaging and extremely satisfying when you nail those difficult sections. You get into such a groove that you want to keep playing and playing. Most games are pretty easy, or easy enough to where you might have some challenge but rarely die, and that can get boring. This is not one of those games. It is an old school challenge that keeps you on edge, but with modern game mechanics such as frequent saves, unlimited lives, and quick respawn. The combat stays interesting due to the parry mechanic (which you have to master to survive) and elemental weapons you unlock throughout (such as a fire sword for ice enemies, ice axe for fire enemies and witches, etc). I played the game twice through back to back. It is fairly lengthy, but I wish there was something more to do after completing the main game. I'm sure I'll come back for another playthrough at some point, it's a nice reprieve from wordy and overly complicated FPSs, RPGs, sports games, etc. Well worth the 10 or whatever I paid for it","['much', 'better', 'average', 'score', 'would', 'believe', 'linear', 'like', 'early', 'castlevania', 'game', 'look', 'combat', 'mechanic', 'similar', 'game', 'like', 'dead', 'cell', 'blasphemous', 'honestly', 'like', 'one', 'best', 'gorgeous', 'bloody', 'metal', 'best', 'part', 'addictive', 'gameplay', 'level', 'many', 'save', 'point', 'save', 'point', 'feel', 'like', 'probably', 'die', 'first', 'time', 'respawn', 'quickly', 'knowledge', 'trap', 'enemy', 'try', 'maybe', 'different', 'approach', 'maybe', 'die', 'might', 'different', 'idea', 'approach', 'next', 'play', 'fun', 'hotline', 'miami', 'super', 'meat', 'boy', 'way', 'may', 'hard', 'explain', 'never', 'played', 'game', 'might', 'sound', 'frustrating', 'also', 'fun', 'engaging', 'extremely', 'satisfying', 'nail', 'difficult', 'section', 'get', 'groove', 'want', 'keep', 'playing', 'playing', 'game', 'pretty', 'easy', 'easy', 'enough', 'might', 'challenge', 'rarely', 'die', 'get', 'boring', 'one', 'game', 'old', 'school', 'challenge', 'keep', 'edge', 'modern', 'game', 'mechanic', 'frequent', 'save', 'unlimited', 'life', 'quick', 'respawn', 'combat', 'stay', 'interesting', 'due', 'parry', 'mechanic', 'master', 'survive', 'elemental', 'weapon', 'unlock', 'throughout', 'fire', 'sword', 'ice', 'enemy', 'ice', 'axe', 'fire', 'enemy', 'witch', 'etc', 'played', 'game', 'twice', 'fairly', 'lengthy', 'wish', 'something', 'completing', 'main', 'game', 'sure', 'come', 'another', 'playthrough', 'point', 'nice', 'reprieve', 'wordy', 'overly', 'complicated', 'fps', 'rpgs', 'sport', 'game', 'etc', 'well', 'worth', 'whatever', 'paid']",much better average score would believe linear like early castlevania game look combat mechanic similar game like dead cell blasphemous honestly like one best gorgeous bloody metal best part addictive gameplay level many save point save point feel like probably die first time respawn quickly knowledge trap enemy try maybe different approach maybe die might different idea approach next play fun hotline miami super meat boy way may hard explain never played game might sound frustrating also fun engaging extremely satisfying nail difficult section get groove want keep playing playing game pretty easy easy enough might challenge rarely die get boring one game old school challenge keep edge modern game mechanic frequent save unlimited life quick respawn combat stay interesting due parry mechanic master survive elemental weapon unlock throughout fire sword ice enemy ice axe fire enemy witch etc played game twice fairly lengthy wish something completing main game sure come another playthrough point nice reprieve wordy overly complicated fps rpgs sport game etc well worth whatever paid,10.0,0.9962,Positive,,0.5023,0.6369,0.62355,0.324675,,0.43615,0.6249,-0.15595,0.22070000000000004,,0.4588

One 'stealth' section of the game is laughably (and worse, frustratingly) bad, and all of these things get in the way of what should have been an interesting and meaningful experience about alcoholism and depression.

It's hard to believe this is a 2014 release. '4PM is a high production value, cinematic experience aimed at people interested in interactive story-telling,' the game's press release reads. Yes, all those things would be true --if it were 2004. It's not, and this game is far too many years too late to be worth the effort of muddling through it.

Half-Life,Valve Software,"Sierra Entertainment, Valve Software, Source Corporation, CyberFront",User,10.0,"Half-Life is, without exaggeration, one of the most influential and impeccably crafted first-person shooters ever released. Even decades after its debut, the game remains a masterclass in environmental storytelling, pacing, and immersion. While many titles from its era have aged into relics, Half-Life endures as a timeless masterpiecea game that feels just as compelling today as it did when it redefined the **** of Half-Life’s greatest achievements is how it builds narrative without relying on traditional cutscenes. Instead of taking control away from the player, it allows the story to unfold organically around you. From the iconic tram ride into Black Mesa to the chaotic aftermath of the resonance cascade, every moment is experienced firsthand. The player isn’t told what happensthey witness it. This approach creates an unparalleled sense of presence and makes Gordon Freeman feel less like a character you're controlling and more like an extension of yourself navigating a deteriorating world.Black Mesa itself is a triumph of level design and atmosphere. The research facility feels functional, believable, and alive in a way few game worlds had before. Laboratories pulse with alarms, hallways buckle under explosions, and scientists desperately cling to hope as the situation spirals out of control. The transitions between areas are seamless, allowing the game to maintain its momentum while giving players the sensation of progressing deeper into a sprawling complex. The pacing is immaculatealternating between quiet tension, intense gunfights, environmental puzzles, and encounters with the horrifying creatures spilling in from Xen.Speaking of enemies, Half-Life’s AI was groundbreaking for its time and still holds up remarkably well. Marines flank, suppress, and retreat with surprising intelligence, forcing players to strategize rather than simply rely on reflex. The alien creatures, from headcrabs to vortigaunts to the terrifying gargantua, each bring their own unique threat. Combat is fast, dynamic, and satisfying, and the variety of enemies ensures the gameplay never feels **** weapon arsenal is another highlight. From the iconic crowbar to the experimental Tau Cannon and Gluon Gun, almost every weapon feels iconic and distinct. Valve managed to create tools that not only fit within the world of Black Mesa, but also deliver some of the most memorable gunplay of the era. Each shot carries weight, and the game avoids the pitfall of padding its arsenal with useless or redundant weapons.Then there’s Xenthe final chapters that have long divided fans. While less visually detailed than the rest of the game, Xen deserves recognition for its ambition. It offers strange geometry, bizarre physics, and environments that truly feel alien. More importantly, it breaks the monotony of another lab corridor and gives narrative meaning to the invasion, culminating in a surreal, unsettling confrontation with the **** sound design, voice acting, and sparse yet impactful soundtrack elevate the overall experience even further. Every scream, explosion, and alien shriek contributes to the oppressive atmosphere. The minimal use of music allows each track to stand out, emphasizing tension or victory at crucial moments.What sets Half-Life apart is how well all these elements combine into a cohesive whole. There are no filler levels, no tonally inconsistent sequences, no unnecessary features weighing the game down. Everything is crafted with intention. Everything serves the experience. It is a game born of visionary design, technical innovation, and bold storytelling choices that the industry still builds upon **** me, Half-Life deserves a perfect 10/10not because it is flawless in a literal sense, but because it is flawless in its impact, ambition, and execution. It is a foundational masterpiece that every fan of the genre should experience at least once.","['without', 'exaggeration', 'one', 'influential', 'impeccably', 'crafted', 'shooter', 'ever',

Seduce Me,,No Reply Games ,User,8.0,"I enjoyed this game immensely and the major reason for that was that one of the women you could get with was a bi/hetero sexually dominant woman. Most games that include a character like that either make her only be attracted to female characters or her motivation for dominating men is some sort of deep seated hatred or contempt of them, or that it is inevitable that you will receive an unsatisfactory ending if you choose to go with a love interest like that (games I won't name here because I would be spoiling them).

In this game though, the dom woman is so simply because it turns her on. That is how her sexuality is and there doesn't need to be any complicated reason for it. And that is just wonderful.

Now, given that the point of these games is mostly wish fulfillment, it was wonderful to see a character like that especially for me who is in the kink lifestyle and I am happy to say the game fulfilled my wishes more than adequately and led me to enjoy the game thoroughly.

The card games are fun and once you get the hang of them, not too difficult. And I kind of like that they function as a good gameplay element when a lot of other visual novels mostly just give you dialogue to choose. It's nice when the objective of the games is often not to win outright but keep your points as close to the opponent's as possible. Certainly brings a bit more variety.

My reasons for liking the game may not apply to everyone, but for those of a similar lifestyle disposition to myself, the game is worth checking out.

FragPunk,Bad Guitar Studio,Bad Guitar Studio,User,5.0,"You're immediately flooded with information in the tutorial at the beginning, which is really annoying and I think could lead many players to uninstall the game before they've even really played it. They should probably work on that, as well as the entire menu, which is so cluttered, nested, and confusing. However, once you get all that behind you, the game is actually a lot of fun. All the other modes aren't really my thing, but there's a team deathmatch mode called 'Bloodbath,' and that's exactly what I like.I also thought beforehand that this ability system would deter me, like in Overwatch and Valorant, for example. But I think it's solved better here than in almost any other game, so much so that even I, as a Call of Duty veteran, can find enjoyment in it.Movement could be a tiny bit faster. It's sometimes difficult to tell whether footsteps are coming from an enemy or my teammates; it would be nicer if you could differentiate better there. I have the impression that there aren't too many maps, or they just randomly repeat. I think I know maybe five maps so far.I'd also like to buy something in the shop to support the game and the developers, but unfortunately, the skins and similar items are significantly too expensive, just like in other games. Those would be the first or only criticisms after a few hours of playing. 7.5/10

Updat: 06.06.25
I've deleted it now. The game was actually a lot of fun, but as it is now, it makes no sense. I only encounter people who play in a party and always run around in threes, getting on my nerves. And as if that wasn't annoying enough, I always end up on the bad team and have to hard-carry my teammates. Plus, I get one-shotted every time, even with full health – how is that possible?! You can even see it in the killcam at the end of the round; the guy takes me and my entire team out within 1 second with the Fennec or the 'Durchgreifer' SMG, and you could clearly see how he killed each of us with a single shot. Coincidentally, I've noticed it's always the people with purchased skins. Obviously there is pay 2 win in this game. It seems you're in protected lobbies for the first few days, and after that, you get thrown into lovely SBMM-infested TTV lobbies i guess. Strangely, in the first few days, I completely dominated, getting 40/12, 50/10, etc., and always found a lobby in a few seconds. Now, I sometimes search for 5-6 minutes, only to then run into some sweaty CoD players with 'ttv' in their names. I can't recommend this game anymore, and I'm deleting it now.

Psychotoxic,NuClearVision,Whiptail Interactive,User,,"It should be noted that this game had the most bundled development cycle. The people who made it had good intentions, but then their publisher quit sending money and had to stitch together what they could with what resources they had.

Where to even begin? Well for one, in order to even RUN the game you have to move the cutscenes to another folder or delete them because the publisher and developer credits are bugged because the game is broken on today's system hardware.  Broken is the keyword. Because they ran out of money the game was shipped unfinished and is even more unfinished than something like Ride to Hell: Retribution. The amount of bugs in the game seems almost endless; in fact it's so buggy you'll die for no apparent reason. That is not a joke.

The story, voice acting, gunplay, level design, ect. is all horrendous. One could go over why each level is terrible in its own right, but there are three that stand out of the 22 levels. The 6th level has  you fight enemies within Airforce 1 (yes, THAT Airforce 1) until you activate an escape pod when doing so a timer starts, you have to get to the pod before time expires. Except, the game doesn't tell you there's a timer nor does it show you that there is one. The level after it is even worse. It takes place in the park in New York where you're supposed to find Dr. Lindstroem, who constantly goes from one place to another, leaving notes on his whereabouts, only to return to the spot where he was originally supposed to be, making the level a ridiculous and annoying chore, especially considering the fact that there is a lot of hostile cops. This level really shows how awful the movement is in the game, in fact bunny hopping is a more legitimate way to move. Also, there is a wall that does not properly extend to the ground which allows you to crawl in and fall to your death.

I saved the best for last. The 21st level shows off one of two game breaking bugs. The minute you spawn into the level, you die. This is due to the fact that you're suppose to run away from rising water, but water rises too quickly and you immediately die. The second game breaking bug I mentioned will occur showing an error message 'OpenGL Error 436' and cause the game to close due to a manufacturing error with the game discs causing their material thickness to be altered, preventing the DVD drive from reading the discs properly. This caused StarForce, the DRM software that the game used, to incorrectly detect it as an illegitimate copy of the game and made it show the error message. Though it should be noted that StarForce itself is an extremely bad copyright-protection system.

[link omitted per site rules] Psychotoxic is without question one of the worst games ever made, but despite all the problems, this game happened all because of the lead developer of the game Frank Fitzner, who had a dream to make a video game and despite how it turned out, made it happen. It's a shame we never saw a remake of this game nor a sequel to see what his vision truly was and we never will. Unfortunately, Frank Fitzner passed away in 2016.

We all at one point in our lives are told to go out and follow our dreams and Frank Fitzner did just that. I want that to be the main takeaway of this game and review. Just remember that if you ever doubt that you can accomplish your dreams remember that despite all the shortcomings Frank Fitzner did just that.

I'm talking about the 'get 30 crystals' mission and the Adamant fight.

Lets make sure there are infinite respawn of enemies, and lets give the enemy caster a bunch of slow/paralyze spells. Now run through this gauntlet and make sure you dont get surrounded by enemies that you cannot possibly kill.  That would be fun- about as fun as being r*ped in the *ss!!!

How about - lets repeat the same kind of **** full heal at each turn fight, give caster a bunch of slow spells and put an infinite respawn of sand monsters that can one hit kill (knock off) your heroes off the map as you run through some maze? That would be fun!!!

It's story is what amazed me the most ; all the voiced dialogues are great and it will all make sense at the end of the game. Heck, it's even better than the average movie Hollywood produces these days. The theme of playing anti heroes is a refreshing perspective as well.

Story aside, the gameplay is fun and hard enough. Playing the game blind is what will make it fun ; a second run might become easy however, when you want to experience the good instead of evil walkthrough. I suggest it to anyone that likes those kind of games.

Epistory - Typing Chronicles,Fishing Cactus,"Fishing Cactus, Big Fish Games, Plug In Digital",User,8.0,"What should you do to attract Tyek's attention to the game? Put a fox in it? Additionally, tie him inextricably to the main character and thus please his eyes with three red putties? NO! This means that the Tyk in question may be interested in such a title. However, it was not the redhead who made Epistory appear in the third GraTyk. I mean, I know you don't believe my **** fact, I was tempted to buy the game during some promotion, where it was really cheap, by two things and one of them was the colorful world with an angular fox, and I will tell you about the second one. (I know you're sighing with relief that this won't be another eulogy for some furries.)Epistory is a game in which the entire world is discovered while traversing it, and it is - at least in the beginnings that I reached - actually colorful and captivating in its own way thanks to its interesting style. To navigate, we use the keyboard, or more precisely, the immortal wasd. (Was! D. As if a supporter of the left who couldn't bear the thought of turning to the right would say. SSSS as a stereotypical resident of Paris would say. Wad according to the Soviet concept, or finally esdf, i.e. Tyk, who constantly puts his fingers on the wrong keys and wonders why it pulls him to the right.) The considerations about naming have one, quite specific purpose. To hide the fact that walking is basically the same as in any other game and it is not worth devoting even a few moments to it. After all, the game was supposed to be unusual and worth attention, and this guy talks about the controls.However, the controls are what is so captivating about this game. Apart from the already mentioned walking, everything is done by writing. Literally everything, because even - after completing several stages - I discovered that it is possible to distribute points gained during the game by entering the name of a skill. Combat involves entering words, which are longer the higher the rank of the opponent. However, the weakest enemies require you to enter only one letter. The further you go, the more words to type becomes a bit overwhelming, but this is where the elements at the fox rider's disposal come to the rescue. I managed to unlock fire and ice and guess what? Switching between them also involves entering the appropriate words. Fire allows certain words to 'write' themselves by burning them out, while ice freezes enemies and prevents them from getting close. Because the enemies can't get to the fox rider unless they throw the girl down and start playing with the redhead. You die from the slightest contact, and of course you can't move while writing. So you have to write quickly! However, it is worth mentioning right away that these words have nothing to do with commands like in old RPGs, where in order for a character to say hello you had to write Hi. Here the words are only loosely related to what is happening on the screen. For example, spider webs are destroyed with words related to bugs, and fires are lit with words related to embers, heat and flames. This is indeed unusual and innovative, although it must be admitted that the game is not perfect. The optimization seems not entirely perfect to me. The plot conveyed by the inscriptions appearing on the ground is not always easy to read, and more importantly, it is not gripping. On the other hand, it is not the beauty of this small game, but the interesting concept, which includes an unusual control concept. And although it is not addictive for a long time, it is not a title that can take away long evenings from your life, it is a pleasant game that is nice to come back to to push the plot forward at least a little. Although definitely not worth the 14 euros it costs on Steam.","['attract', 'tyek', 'attention', 'game', 'put', 'fox', 'additionally', 'tie', 'inextricably', 'main', 'character', 'thus', 'please',

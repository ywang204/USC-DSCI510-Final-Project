In October of 2012 the developers filed for Bankruptcy. I haven't seen a really decent explanation of why LoP was released before it was ready although many claim that's how Kalypso does business. Others say publishers are pushing developers into premature release of their games. Some sites were still taking orders for LoP at the time that Novacore announced its insolvency which is, IMHO, inexcusable. The only reason why some people were spared is bc players posted warnings not to buy the game.   More than a few people reported that they were denied refunds due to game time logged even though they were not able to actually play the game. This calls into question the ethics of charging players for games not yet published. Aren't beta players really assisting developers in identifying problems needing to be solved? Shouldn't there be some kind of reward offered to the people who play pre-release games? How fair is it to charge people who participate in beta testing the full price for the game when they are the ones assuming the risk that the game might flop?""}, {'score': None, 'text': 'DO NOT BUY THIS!!!

The first work from the studio that created the jewel that is Death's Door absolutely had to be played. I wanted to understand how a game like the one released in 2021 was born and to do this the best way is to find out where they started. What can I say with a start like this you can only go high!The Manchester studio began its adventure in the infinite world of video games in 2015, basing its creation on minimalist Pixel Art graphics, on an inspired and varied setting and building everything around a high and ruthless difficulty, with shades of frustration in the air.With a top-down view, a barely mentioned story and a basic tutorial, the player is introduced to the game with a single purpose: to kill the 'Titans'. Majestic, agile and ruthless creatures that populate mini areas scattered here and there around the world.There are no 'simple' enemies, only checkpoints in strategic positions, in order to make recovery after game over simple and many bosses to face.Once you enter the arena the battle begins and there are only two ways to get out: alive, hitting the monster's weak point, or dead, the more probable **** hit is enough to trigger the game over but the same goes for the opponent we will face, with the only obligation that we should hit him in his 'hidden' weak point with the only arrow present in our hero's quiver. That's right, just an arrow which, however, can be thrown and retrieved infinitely either by walking on it or by recalling it with telekinetic powers, taking into account that without a weapon we are effectively harmless and at the mercy of the monster. In a nutshell, the clash with a new creature is divided into two phases: the first of gathering information and modus operandi of the giant in question and the second of implementing the attack plan, carefully designed in one's head, to get the upper hand . Many attempts separate the player from victory, especially with the last ruthless giants, but the goal to be achieved is never too far away, and the satisfaction of seeing the David within us defeat the Goliath of the moment, will manage to tear more than a smile from lips of those who will be able to seize the best moment to strike.David Fenn's first musical works already show the talent and skill of the English singer-songwriter which years later will lead him to create one of my favorite soundtracks, that of Death's door!The staging in this title is obviously still immature, a sort of embryonic version of what will later become a very respectable soundtrack in the subsequent work. But despite this, he does his accompanying work damn well and more than one track will have the ability to carve out a space in the hearts of fans. This is for two reasons: one unconscious, as by repeating a clash infinite times and then listening to the notes continuously the player will end up loving (or hating) the tracks and the other because some music will have the ability to give us a boost in times of need to win the battle.Acid Nerve's inspiration from Fumito Ueda's game Shadow of the Colossus released 10 years earlier is great; a character in a lonely world who must defeat creatures who are even difficult to approach. Of course, the differences on a technical, graphic, setting and duration level bring the two titles to different levels of the global video game scale. The work of Team Ico has entered history and the hearts of fans, something that the first work of the English team will never be able to do. Despite this, I consider the Indie 'game' an experience, which however short, deserves to be lived. Of course it is not a title for those who get discouraged at the first difficulty but only for those, like me, who get excited in the most challenging moments. Let's be clear, nothing is impossible, we just need to get carried away and savor with calm, perseverance and attentive eyes the right moment to launch the arrow into the Titan's 'Achilles' heel'.""}]"

When I think of this DLC I think of it as one of the best DLCs of all time.\n\nThis DLC is like a sequel - with everything! Its WAST gorgeous map with highly enjoyable exploration.  There are several 'bioms' with different theme and feeling to it. Music and ambience of the places is magical. Bosses and chunkier enemies are fun. There are several NPCs with questlines which are comparably good with the main game. The price could feel a bit much for a DLC, but I sunk 80hours to my first playthrough and I would say that games for that price tag giving you usually less. And you couldn t say this DLC is just some appendix, it is full-fledged story expansion.\n\nMy only gripe for console players is that you need to have save saved or be good at speedrunning for reaching the point when you can enter the DLC... I would be glad that FromSoft be in the future more generous with choices for subsequent playthroughs like (yes, you can rant how ridiculous was the state of the game after launch, but they do quite a job on it and the game is quite a looker and runs smoothly) Lord of the Fallen or Lies of P (in the terms of mix and match the equipment possibilities) - you could unlock something during first plathrough and have it ticked somewhere if you choose to for next playthrough. These games are massive and I understand there is a picky community and splendid no-hit-runners and all, but that is not all. Some quality of life things would not dismantle the difficulty or anything, just to have more fun with more weapons and theirs unique move sets. I enjoyed DLC more because i had all smithing stones and I was not bothered to farm somthing, at last! The runes I acquired during playthrough went straight to the smithing stones and I could use any weapon right away. I would really love the idea for the future when you are finding the materials for the 'tree of weapons' not for individual weapons - especially when the game is that big as Elden ring or this DLC and you have TONS of nice looking weapons which you will never use because you would just farm something for it(even if you are ok with just lvl24/lvl9 weapon).""}]"

Perhaps more than I should have. But I get told that a lot. Apparently you're only meant to have a 'little bit of fun' over-waxing the floor at a shopping centre. Normal people falling is fun, but when the kid on crutches does the exact same thing - no more fun. I learn things everyday.\r\nFor example, today when I was looking for this game on Metacritic I learned that it's had several name changes for no good reason. I looked for the game I played titled ORION: Prelude, but couldn't find it until I realised it used to be called ORION: Dino Horde. And that in itself was a rebrand from ORION: Dino Beatdown. You know that guy in 'The Good Place' that went to hell for being too indecisive? Well, Spiral Game Studios is where he got his training. I can only imagine what ORION: New Circle of Hell they're in for when they die.\r\nSo this game released to raving negative reviews. It was more broken than that crutches kid after having a personal introduction to that floor. And while several bugs remain to this day, for the most part this game has since been made a stable experience. Just don't play the Summit map. You shouldn't be playing that anyway. Without the bugs that's still just the worst map. You could say that Summit really peaked in annoying game design.\r\ni'll see myself out now...\r\nBut yeah, other than Summit turning the skybox and half the models completely black, meaning good luck seeing all those pterodactyls soaring around in the endless void, the game is truly playable. Now I don't wanna excuse a dev team for releasing and selling a broken product only to fix it later because, as we now know, this would become an anti-consumer standard practice in the industry. However, I'll let this slide as it was their first game and they seemed to improve this attitude for their next release before disappearing forever. Yea, it's just hard to be mad at something that doesn't exist. Although my girlfriend would disagree with that statement after I cheated on her with my co-worker. I'm an internet funny man. I don't have a co-worker. But hey, the realm of physicality won't stop me from having an imaginary ORION: Post-Lube Inspection. Apparently.\r\nAnyway, video game. I only played the survival mode during my time with this game. There are less-than-a-few players still hopping around these servers. That's a real shame, because those strange times when another person from somewhere in the world did decide to load up this strange game 9 years after release and found my lobby were the best times. There are bots that try to help if no one else joins your game. I specifically say 'try to help' because their only use was as ORION: Dino Bait. They won't repair the generator you're defending, they won't use anything other than the basic rifle, and only rarely will they feel the need to pick you up after you've been downed. No, mostly their job description suggests they should run around erratically like a headless chicken until dinos show up and then they plant their feet firmly and take on the horde with their face. They kill a good deal of them before they die though. That's sweet of them.\r\nThis makes a great deal of otherwise optional things an absolute necessity because you are now fulfilling the roles of 5 team members, regardless of which class you pick. Trying to repair the generator will set all the big boss dinos on you immediately, like they're offended by the sounds engineers make. So you won't have a chance to get it back up before the knockback sends you to another map. Unless it's the T-Rex which either chomps you, or if you have the no-chomp upgrade, simply lodges you inside its model where you cannot leave as it slowly nibbles on the salty snack that was your face.\r\nSo with all these problems, why did I say I had fun? 2 reasons mostly.\r\nReason number A: I love most of the environments. It's not the most graphically appealing game, or the one with the most detailed worlds. Yet, most of the maps really do look pretty. I'm a **** for open spaces and over-saturated colours in everything, and this game REALLY scratches that itch. I also love the look of the jagged and interestingly structured mountains.\r\nReason number II: Play the assault class and buy the TREK bow. I had so much dumb fun jetpacking around popping off arrows at dinos and watching them fall like Hawkeye in Avengers, except I actually achieve something.  Then there's the alternative arrows. If you do manage to get a player in your game do a favour for me, would ya? When they're in a vehicle and least expect it, fly to the top of a mountain a knock out their car with an EMP arrow. The arrows are too small to see and you are way out of sight so they'll never know what happened. And that makes me happy.\r\nSo I did have a lot of dumb fun playing this game. I can't recommend it as a brilliant product, but I can tell you to just do it anyway\r\nJust play ORION: Subtitle Pending""}, {'score': 10, 'text': ' .   , , ,  .  .'}, {'score': 6, 'text': ""TL;DR at the bottom for those with little time to spare :)\r\n\r\nObjectively speaking, this game is meh, it's a bit of dumb fun with friends that can keep you occupied for maybe 1-2 hours.

Unfortunately I feel the need to point out that if you're a fanatic TBS player like myself, it still holds no challenge (unless you let it cheat) once you figure the ins and outs of the game.  The music is average, the graphics are excellent, and the gameplay is utterly fantastic.\r\n\r\nGalactic Civilizations 2's ship editor is one of the most impressive I have ever seen.  No need to take my word for it, just use google and look at what other people have made using it.\r\n\r\nThe planet micro management portion is quite interesting, with each planet having a chance to have certain tiles that give a  bonus to production/research/etc that makes each and every planet worth colonizing in the long run.  That crappy 4-5 quality planet that you'd normally ignore in search of something better?  It might just have a 800 production tile that makes it outstrip every other planet in the sector when it comes to building your war fleets.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of war, that's the one part of the game that keeps me from giving galactic civilizations 2 a 10 out of 10.  When it comes to combat, it really is a matter of rock/paper/scissors in terms of defense and offense.  You have lasers, missiles, guns and a corresponding defense for each.  All combat boils down to is who has more weapon 'points' that isn't covered by their enemy's defense points, and how many ships you have.  It doesn't get more complicated than that, which is a real shame.  One need only look at games like Master of Orion 2 to see how it could have been done better.  A turn based combat system that actually let you control the ships would have opened up entirely new avenues of fun and possibility.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a great game with almost no bugs (I have been playing it for well over a year and the only issue I ever encountered was a strange bug where I loaded a save and all ships had 1hp and 1 movement) that could have used minor tweaking in a few areas to truly be the game of the year instead of just great.""}, {'score': 10, 'text': ""Instead of spending a lot of time to say WHY this game is GREAT, I'll just make a USEFUL review.\r\n\r\nLook that the NEGATIVE reviews (only EIGHT as of march/2014).

It's an ARPG in the Diablo style but, due to the Devourer's power, you'll control a variety of different characters instead of a single one. This makes the game feel fresh and interesting.\r\nToo bad the game has some big flaws:\r\nLoading screen are insanely long and there are quite a lot. There's a loading screen even for when you\r\nwant to change the party formation - you can have only 3 characters in your party plus the devourer - which made me almost never try new characters combination and killing one of the best characteristics of the game. You can't even equip or level up the inactive characters without traveling to the character select room (which is pointless also because it's just a room with the 'puppets' and a single vendor, there was really no need to have it), leading to a very cluttered inventory. It also kills exploration. You will really spend a insane amount of time on loading screens, and you will think twice about loading the game if you don't have a lot of free time on your hands.\r\nControls are bad. Really bad. They're unresponsive, the character often stops insted of attacking or just moves away, right mouse button is useless and the feeling is generally very very clunky. The combat feels often like a chore and it's not too funny.\r\nCrafting is very tedious and pointlessly time consuming due to the badly readable interface for it. Absolutely pointless, also because you can never craft items better than what you find.\r\n\r\nNow for the good part of it... there are some really good ideas in this. The party system is very interesting and adds something new to a overused genre. The world is beautiful and engaging, and makes you want to know more about it. The graphics are quite good: clean, readable, colorful, stylish.\r\nThe musics are absolutely fantastic. My favourite part of the game.

I really love some of the sidequest  books with great stories, like one of the first books you find in the game outside the sewers, detailing a vampire that tricks a vampire hunter to eliminate his competition, posing as a vampire hunter, then kills him once he's finished his usefulness :) The game does wear thin on some storylines, like in the Shivering Isles where I did stop caring very much to do sidequests and the novelty of everyone being crazy wore off after a bit. But the main guilds, Shivering Isles, and the Main Quest actually for me especially all had good stories. I was surprised how much I liked the Main Quest, as so many people talk down on it online. But Martin's character especially elevated the story so much and I really came to respect him  see him as a very worthy successor to the Empire, and was really sad when he had to sacrifice himself.\n\n\nThe Knights of the Nine story for me fell flat, as the threat of Umaril was pretty far off and kind of random, with very little setup at least for me. I know the stories of Pelinal Whitestrake  Umaril fairly well and the game didn't do a great job setting up that history for the player, outside of the books you can read in-game. Pelinal is also not really a good/moral character, so the whole Knights of the Nine holiness and self-righteousness feels extremely hollow but I feel the game wanted you to think they are following a culture/leader who was on the side of good. Except Pelinal was an insane cyborg and/or time-traveller it seems who just was crazy and wanted to kill all non-humans : Anyways all the other main stories in the game were quite good, so this DLC's didn't bring the game down too much for me.\n\nThe gameplay was better than I remembered from playing most of the game as a teenager. The sword play  magic systems work well imo, and I miss the ability to make your own spells in Skyrim. I honestly don't mind the sword  board gameplay of Oblivion  Skyrim and think they are fun overall :) The mix of meele, archery, magic,  sneaking is a great formula for Elder Scrolls game and brings lots of options  diversity to a build.\n\nThe music is incredible, just amazing :) I would say its a 9/10 compared to like an 11/10 for Skyrim, and I downloaded some of the tracks for Oblivion, while I downloaded every single track from Skyrim. Jeremy Soule did really well to set the mood  atmosphere for Oblivion, but damn did he knock it out of the park with Skyrim.\n\nLastly, the overall ability to experience what you wish and create a fantasy character to roleplay with is pretty vast and fun to experience. I recommend Oblivion to any fan of fantasy RPG games, as its one of the greatest and pinnacles in the genre :)""}]"

At first, it sounds incredibly basic. Just a blocky world to mine resources, build, and survive. Of course, it is referred to as a sandbox survival game?€? title. In most games, you are provided with an objective. The story and levels tell you what to do. Minecraft is not such a game. When you first spawn, you are not provided with some sort of tutorial, and you're left without any sort of cinematic. You start off by finding yourself in just another randomly generated world, and it is up to you to, well, 'figure it out' and explore. You could go along the 'survival' route and obtain some wood, craft yourself a tool, and fend off monsters during the night, but the game never forces it on you. The biggest reason Minecraft stands out is the freedom it gives you. Every part of the world is made of blocks that you can break and place anywhere you want. That means the entire world is basically a giant paint canvas that lets any player who plays the game paint their own vision and lets them do more than just play. If you want to build a massive city, an underground base, a sky island, or even try to recreate real-life landmarks, the game lets you do it. There isn?€?t a correct way to play, which is very different from most games. Minecraft allows you to play it the way you want because it has lots of worlds, and you can select the ones you prefer. Survival has obstacles to overcome, such as mining resources, exploring caves, and becoming more powerful. In creative mode, you are not restricted to anything. You have infinite resources, and you can fly. You also don?€?t have to concern yourself with death so that you can explore and build. It is not really a game but more of a digital palette where people can show their expression. Minecraft is cool since it mixes a bunch of game types into one. Sometimes it feels like you're just trying to survive, sometimes it feels like you're on some crazy quest. And, you can build stuff, or just hang out with friends on a server! One day you might explore a lot of caves. Next, you might decorate your house. Then maybe you go trade with villagers, or play mini games other players made. In the end, what makes Minecraft so great is the amount of control it allows the player to have. The game never puts it into your head what it is you are supposed to be doing, it lets you decide. Whether it is beating the Ender Dragon, doing something creative, such as building an impressive structure, or just exploring, it allows you to do what it is you want to. These are the elements of why people continually go back to Minecraft every year.""}, {'score': 10, 'text': 'Sin ning??n tipo de duda, el mejor juego de la historia, este juego me cambio la vida.

Much different to the GTA 4/5 protagonists who (while efficient) constantly seem like they don't want to do any of this and are instead acting out of anger or doing it for someone else.\n\nNot a Shakespeare level story but pretty decently written and interesting. My favourite quests were the biker gangs, the cab missions after you buy it as an asset and the 'film studio' ones.\n\nI love love LOVE how fast you can run in this game, i feel like a jacked psychopath protagonist which is absolutely the vibe.\n\nSpeaking of, the general vibe, colour pallette, music and fashion do such a really good job of showing the 80's time period. Banger after banger on the radio, i added a bunch to my spotify. \n\nso if i like the game so much, why is is the same as my GTA 3 score?\nwell one it would be a 7.4 if i could actually rate this how i want, above gta 3's strict 7. **** metacritics rating system.\n\nmore importantly two, there are so many controller throwing, unnecessarily hard, punishing, long winded missions and sections that made it an incredibly frustrating playthrough, much more than the first game. \n\nthe game lies saying there is checkpoints, but it just restarts you at the beginning of the mission. while this was in the previous game this is much more frustrating because Vice City has much longer multi-layered missions compared to GTA 3.\n\nThe game also is not obvious in progression of missions, certain character quests one after another end without a sense of conclusion. I rarely knew, at the end of all missions with a character, that it was the end. \n\nThis carries over into requirements to get the ending. I had finished every single mission i possibly could, including all of the gang missions on both sides of the gang war, I even did a telephone and basic cab driving mission which in any other circumstance i would never do. I had no idea what to do from there, or whether i had already finished all the missions unbeknownst to me.\n\nWELL turns out i should have been buying property the entire time! the OPTIONAL properties have their own missions which when you complete about 20, after buying EVERY SINGLE CHAIN, then you can play the final two missions and finish the game :3\n\nThis comes out of NOWHERE, and hit me like a truck. I had spent all of the money I had got in the game on ammo and guns, oversupplying myself because the game did such a poor job at explaining what else i could do with it. I was then softlocked out of getting the ending because i was broke, and couldn't get more money because i had done all the missions already. \n\nThis forced me to reload a save from hours ago losing progress and do a glitched mission called 'Cone Crazy' which if you do right, gives you millions if you get good at beating your score. \n\nFinally after about 40 mins of grinding and an hour or two of doing what i had already done, I could do the missions which took about four hours. \n\nthere was a whole 1/3 of the game unknown to me because the game never highlighted it was possible. I had to find it online out of disbelief. When I looked at the comment section for the tutorial on how to get the ending, there were dozens of commentors saying they had been stuck as I had for DECADES with no idea what to do or where to go.\n\nreally bad game design.\n\nand this especially **** because Vice Cities ending kicks ass, there is a decent twist and you get a scarface showdown in your mansion against the main antagonist of the game. it's really sad most people won't get to experience it, because they were never directed in the ways to unlock it.\n\ndespite my gripes with the process to get the last half, i still had quite a blast and enjoyed playing.""}, {'score': 10, 'text': 'per me uno dei migliori GTA,vasto,divertente,completo,coinvolgente,musica meravigliosa peccato per la difficolta a tratti frustante'}]"

Unfortunately our hero has a tendency to rubber-band back and forth on certain screens when running, taking longer to cover ground than simply walking. Some exits, such as the exit to the main plaza, are not actually marked. In almost every other room, hovering the cursor over exits immediately morphs the cursor into a door, letting you know there is an exit-- this is not the case for the exit to the plaza, which is a nondescript-looking  landing that only displays the regular walking icon.\r\n\r\nMovement alone, however, is not the only obstacle the player must surmount. Hotspot recognition is extremely finicky, which is aggravated by very poor puzzle design. Developers nowadays must walk a thin line between avoiding the heights of insanity we've seen in some adventure game puzzles of ages past (use an inflatable rubber duck to rescue a key from a canal? The Longest Journey, I'm looking at you...) and avoiding serving everything to the player on a silver platter. Sadly, Hoodwink does serve things on a silver platter. An example of this is the first quest you come upon: As soon as you have escaped from Detective Pyre's  office, you decide to talk to your hippie friend (Saffron) for advice on how to pull off your proposal. Her advice? You need to get some chocolates, make yourself smell good, and get your paws on a bouquet of roses.\r\n\r\nHow difficult is it to achieve these goals? Not difficult at all. In fact, all you need to do is go up one floor, stroll around, and just pick things up as you find them. Two items require you to interact with one character and one element of the environment respectively, and the chocolates require you to find a certain individual in the plaza (and, of course, figure out where that exit is...)  and that's it, the challenge is pretty much nonexistent. Later puzzles, such as the one involving a lantern, feel like filler to pad out the experience more than anything else and really don't flow well at all.  Puzzles are not necessarily the backbone of adventure games- characters and settings are- but when you have them, they need to reinforce the experience instead of detracting from it.\r\n\r\nThese glaring issues are a real shame, because the world of Hoodwink is fascinating. Although not explored at length, the quirky society with its odd denizens and rather black sense of humor do beg for your attention, and you'll be wanting to see more of it by the time the curtain comes down.\r\n\r\nThe graphics are eccentrically unique, a blend of gritty dystopian and cartoony playfulness realized in cel-shaded 3D. Characters do make an impression with their personalities:  a second-chancer robot who thinks he still has a stomach, a trash can who is trying to commit suicide by jumping into an incinerator, the anachronistically flower-powered Saffron, and of course your fianc??e- the game has more than its share of excellent characterization, and this is the area where it truly shines. The universe is also positively bizarre- if anthropomorphic detectives and brain-carrying robots weren't enough, mutations have also affected flowers: Saffron's supply room is populated by a large carnivorous plant that guards over a crowd of dancing, anthropomorphic roses. Some good throwaway comedy lines can be  heard in crowd scenes - but their impact is lessened  when heard for the tenth time, repeated by different voice actors (a slight d??j?? vu of Oblivion's rather schizophrenic voice acting.) Perhaps one of my favorite lines comes from UniCorp's boys in blue, constantly and cheerfully reminding passersby that 'Unlawfulness will be met with courteous and lethal response!'\r\n\r\nThe music is more of a mixed bag- although the sparse soundtrack is stylistically appropriate to match the future-dystopia-meets-noir theme, traclks seem to be triggered at random and after long periods of silence with no discernible rhyme or reason: At one point a tune sprung up in the middle of a lengthy conversation with Saffron, and at least two themes were playing simultaneously when I entered her supply room.""}, {'score': 7, 'text': ""Ok so this game has a great story, good voice acting and a really interesting and varied looking world basically everything that doesn't rely on technical programming.

Sound familiar? No, this isn?€?t Broken Sword, though the first game in that series did come first. This is Runaway: A Road Adventure, featuring the exploits of Brian Basco, college student, and Gina Timmins, a lounge singer (actually a stripper) who witnessed a murder by the mafia. While the gameplay and mechanics are a typical point  click affair, the story and characters are very colorful and engaging. For a game that had trouble before, during, and after production, it?€?s pretty amazing that it was ever released. Though it equal parts surprised and disappointed me, I enjoyed it and can see why it did so well in Spain and, eventually, the US.\nLet?€?s start with Brian. He?€?s supposed to be a nerd, but I never really got that impression. Sure he?€?s rather smart and wears glasses, but he seems more like a regular guy. Maybe it?€?s because of how he?€?s designed. If the developers were going for a stereotypical nerd look, they would?€?ve made him much skinnier. I saw a comment on Twitter that described another character as a nerd wearing a varsity jacket,?€? and I think this explains Brian pretty well. He was initially going to college to study applied physics, after all. And the way he solves some of the game?€?s puzzles could only happen with some clever, creative thinking. Even though the story is linear and Brian can?€?t die, you still feel a sense of urgency when combining items together knowing the Mafia could show up at any minute. Something I appreciated about Brian is that he wasn?€?t the typical man some adventure games have. He effortlessly stitched a basketball, wasn?€?t afraid to carry around some lipstick, and treated three drag queens with respect. That?€?s impressive, considering this was 2001.\nI was also impressed by the backgrounds in this game, though they did seem a little busy. From Manhattan to Arizona, there was always something to look at. Even something as simple as a bathroom had multiple items in it. One of the more detailed places was the Museum of Archeology and Natural History. There were some dinosaur skeletons on display, and you could practically count every single bone. And the artifact restoration room was filled with shelves of items and various gadgets from floor to ceiling. The analyses laboratory didn?€?t skimp on crazy details either, what with all the computers and scanners and such. Though the characters stood out from the backgrounds, given how they were animated, you still really felt like you were in the same places. I hope the people who worked on the backgrounds were paid well enough.\nSo where did Runaway: A Road Adventure fall short? Sigh, where do I even begin? A lot of this is product of its time?€? stuff but should still be talked about. There was a short, black man who was an informant for the Mafia with the nickname Munchkin Bob.?€? Calling a little person that can be considered both infantilizing and dehumanizing. Also, and this is a great personal grievance of mine, Native Americas were constantly referred to as Indians throughout the game. And this is after Brian actually called them Native Americans to start with. As if things couldn?€?t get offensive enough, he meets a character named Joshua in the desert who?€?s a horribly racist Japanese stereotype. Fake accent, buck teeth, ill-fitting clothes, the works. And this is from a game company in Spain. You would expect this sort of thing from America, but apparently, it?€?s a global problem. The stiff, robotic animation is a whole other argument, but that mostly can be forgiven due to the fact that a, it?€?s 2001, and b, the developers at Pendulo Studios were in constant financial crisis.\nOther missteps include having to go pixel hunting for certain objects, as they blend with the backgrounds a little too well, along with some of the puzzles not being solved in a logical way. There?€?s a lot of trial and error trying to figure out what combines and what doesn?€?t, which takes away from enjoying the game. Plus, when planning to save Gina in the desert, Brian repeats the plan the more items he gets to help him enact it. Like, you don?€?t need to repeat the whole plan every single time, just mention the new parts. Players are smarter than you think. And Brian gave up on Gina a little too quickly after she fell down a hole. At least try to look for her first before thinking she?€?s dead. Speaking of Gina, while I wasn?€?t thrilled with her outfit choices (especially in the desert; seriously, boobs can get sunburnt too), the fact that she was more of a plot device than a character didn?€?t do her justice. If Brian hadn?€?t accidently hit her with his car, they never would?€?ve met and she probably would?€?ve died. She goes through so much throughout the course of the game and yet she?€?s regulated to a secondary character. There?€?s more to her than just looks, and I find myself wondering how things would?€?ve been different if she was the protagonist.'}, {'score': 10, 'text': 'One of the most interesting games of my childhood.

I mean, Dev's, this game is oldish, i get it - but why would you hide things from the player in an Adventure genre?  Why?\r\n\r\nI played all 3 games of the series.

It's no doubt that Driver 3 is one of the best looking games from the original Xbox / PS2 era - and the visuals are elevated by the Nice and Istanbul locations that you visit throughout the course of the game.\r\nAs with previous Driver games, the core mechanics of driving and car chases have always been a high point and the same can be said here. Some of the game's missions, particularly ones focused on vehicle sections, were made memorable as a result of the way vehicle physics are handled. It's also really exhilarating to see cars explode, but vehicle explosions aren't too great since you can still enter the same car as a wrecked chasse.\r\nWhile I found the driving controls very responsive and made the game more fun, I really didn't understand the need for the on-foot combat sections; the shooting is really boring and I just wanted each section to be over and done with. The AI also felt extremely basic and poorly-scripted, enemies will stay in place and don't really seem to move all that much - making a lot of combat scenarios much easier than they should be. Beyond that, I also experienced a handful of bugs during my time of play. Many of the bugs I witnessed froze or soft locked my console and ultimately forced me to reset.\r\nWould I recommend this game to anyone? Probably not. But if you have a love games from this time period, or even have a strong passion for action, you may find something that you will like about Driver 3 - but don't take my word for it. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas came out much stronger than this one, and is much more recommendable in my books.""}]"

One thing I thought Orwell lacked that the sequel fixed was voice acting for the phone calls. It was not only a nice feature to add but the voice acting was well done. You can also now influence social media by finding data chunks that fit a certain narrative. The feature itself was decent but it kind of tied into one thing I didn?€?t like about Ignorance is Strength and that was the perspective. In the original you were doing ethically dubious deeds but were at least trying to find a bomber. In the sequel your objective felt far less worth the effort after the first chapter or so. One thing I will say is that I fully believe many governments would take part in the kind of petty actions that happen in this game. While I was a bit disappointed in where the story went I at least enjoyed the characters and the twists and turns they took as well as how the sequel tied into the original. It takes place at the same time as the original with you working on a totally separate case although it does overlap slightly. One more issue I had was that once again I found that the game didn?€?t stay true to what it asks of you. Your boss says to leave out data that doesn?€?t matter but at least a couple times I had to add, what I deem to be, subjective data chunks that were more opinion than fact in order to progress.\r\n\r\nI played Ignorance is Strength on Linux. It never crashed and I didn?€?t notice any bugs or spelling mistakes. There are no graphics options. Alt-Tab didn?€?t work. The game saves on exit but there is just one save file so it always gets overwritten.

What the game lacks in technical game design and innovative gameplay, it makes up for with an large, freeing world and charm.\n\nGAMEPLAY: 7/10 - The core gameplay of Fallout 3 is very simple and easy to understand. The game gives you a lot of freedom with these basic mechanics however, meaning you can squeeze plenty of hours of messing around out of the game. There is a decent amount of jank to the game but this is to be expected and arguably adds to the experience when funny things happen in the game.\n\nSTORY: 6/10 - The main story in Fallout 3 is fine, but doesn't do much to go beyond that. The stakes feel very low most of the time due to the aforementioned 'charm' that Bethesda's characters have, even the villains of the world. In addition to this, the story just simply isn't that interesting. On the other hand, most players likely aren't going to be playing this game in hopes of a beautiful and inspiring story, and for that reason the story is passable in this context.  \n\nSOUNDTRACK: 9/10 - While I am doubtful that many players are coming to Fallout 3 specifically for any of it's original pieces, it's soundtrack is very enjoyable to listen to via the radio while you explore the wasteland and loot settlements. All of the songs chosen fit the same vibe and are a blast to listen to.\n\nCHARACTERS: 7/10 - The characters that you meet in Fallout 3 all for the most part have the loveable 'Bethesda' charm that most players have come to expect from the developers. While most of them aren't particularly fleshed out, they work in the context of the game and are fun to communicate with. \n\nGRAPHICS/VISUALS: 6/10 - Fallout 3 is an old game (2008) so obviously will look worse than a modern game, however I think the intentionally bleakness and realism of the game from the time hides this a lot worse than a lot of other games from a similar era that simply hold up better (and looked better at the time). Graphics aren't everything but this game definitely is far from a visual masterpiece.\n\nCUTSCENES: 7/10 - While there isn't many cutscenes in Fallout 3, the few that are present are perfectly serviceable and get the point they need to across.\n\nOverall, Fallout 3 is a very enjoyable game and while it isn't the best game technically, it is more than worth picking up and playing. There is a certain charm only contained within Bethesda games that players yearn for, and this game along with Oblivion and Skyrim are great ways to get that experience.""}, {'score': 6, 'text': ' 3  (6.0)\n    ,     .         ,            .     ,                .             .          ,         ,      .      ,     .     .'}]"

It?€?s clearly a tune inspired by other survival-horror classics, but it has its own unique tempo and melody. And it?€?s a darkly catchy one, to boot. '}]","[{'score': 9, 'text': 'Song of Horror is an unnerving, old-school singleplayer horror game, sharing qualities with blockbusters such as Resident Evil and Silent Hill.\nThe story begins with the disappearance of the acclaimed writer Sebastian P. Husher, causing an array of characters to investigate his disappearance. Each character has their own background, and although the death of your character does not mean game over, it does require the player to switch to a different character. However, the player may wish to retrieve their previous character?€?s items, requiring them to undergo a similar journey to the one that killed them initially, unsettling the player through re-experiencing a similar journey to what caused their death. If all characters die, some players find it frustrating to have to restart an entire episode after one final small mistake, but in my opinion, the steep learning curve just adds to the reality of the dangers in this game - one moment of shock does not compare to the hours of dread that come while the player is exploring Song of Horror?€?s environments.\nThe main antagonist of Song of Horror is The Presence, a powerful entity that constantly shadows the protagonist, learning the way the player approaches the game and adapting to their playing style ?€? rather than being a single monster, The Presence acts an adaptive tracker that exploits the player through their weaknesses instead of relying on brute force; the game is absent of any combat mechanics and instead puts more emphasis on escaping any threats, almost all of which are entirely unpredictable, invoking a certain element of tension. No two encounters with The Presence seem the same, helping with the game?€?s replay-ability.\nThe disturbing atmosphere, formed particularly by the intricate sound design and music, contribute to the game being ideal for almost all horror seekers. Despite this, it must be noted that the visual graphics are nothing exceptional, clearly targeting an audience more familiar with a classic, minimalistic side of horror. Hence, I?€?d argue that the game is more enjoyable for old school players, and certain mechanics such as fixed camera angles and slow pacing continue to divide players?€? opinions. Bugs in Song of Horror are rare, but if I had to make a criticism about the game?€?s quality, I?€?d consider mentioning the occasional frame rate drops.\nOverall, Song of Horror succeeds as a chilling tribute to classic survival horror, masterfully blending atmosphere, lore, and gameplay. Its tense exploration and ominous soundscape create an experience few modern horror titles achieve. While the visuals are modest and the pacing deliberate, these choices reinforce its classical charm. The game offers up to 50 hours of playtime, impressively thought-provoking puzzles, and a rare balance between story depth and mechanical challenge. At around 30 for the complete edition, it delivers excellent value for players seeking a truly disturbing and rewarding horror experience.'}, {'score': 7, 'text': ""A hidden indie horror gem.

I'm really looking forward to a 2nd part or another game like this.\r\n\r\nPROS: responsive and smooth controls  varied game  different kind of fighting (different swords and magic, both max powered option)  challenging game  etc\r\nCONS: sometimes it can be very difficult but if you insist, you're patient and think about the combination of sword and magic (and their max powered) you'll finally beat""}, {'score': 6, 'text': ""Slain is a rare success story in the sense that it released in horrific condition and instead of washing their hands of it and cashing what little money they made from it the devs actually fixed it, and so we have Slain: Back from Hell which is basically version 2.0 and it fixes most of the issues that plagued initial release build, which is reflected in the recent (very positive) and overall (mixed) scores in the Steam user reviews section.\r\n\r\nI'd like to start off by saying Slain is hard, almost frustratingly so at times so you're going to die, a lot. Going into the game I didn't quite understand how challenging it was meant to be so it was quite the shock. Just for reference I have finished Bloodborne, the Dark Souls series and Salt  Sanctuary so I'm no stranger to hard games but Slain had a way of making me feel like it was being unnecessarily hard or even cheap just for the sake of it at times, however for the most part the game was a solid, enjoyable challenge, it's just a shame the overall experience was tarnished a little due to a few rare outliers that left me saying to myself 'Really?.....', for example certain mobs have brutally tight timings on their counter attack, and when you have to hit multiple of them in a row without taking a single hit it can be frustrating, and it was. I also found myself begging to the Metal Gods themselves for a checkpoint at times after a tough section or mob but was left wanting which again caused frustration when I died and had to do it all again. I'd like to make it clear though, for the most part this isn't an issue, but these blips really did hurt my enjoyment of the game and I think Slain would benefit greatly from a final tuning phase.\r\n\r\nDifficulty aside the game is tight for the most part, but I did run into a couple of issues where my attacks would pass through enemies, most notably on the final boss, I also had an issue where the charge up attack would sometimes cancel before the *ching* even though I was holding down the button still, it didn't happen a lot but enough to become very frustrating, especially as it often meant death when it occurred. Other than those issues the gameplay is good, the controls feel responsive and the combat is enjoyable, I would highly recommend using the D-Pad over the thumb sticks, though, as it was far more accurate IMO.\r\n\r\nTechnically I had no issues, I played the game on a GTX 970 / 3570k  4.3GHz and it ran at a solid 60fps throughout on maximum settings which is what you'd expect, but it's not always the case sadly so I thought I'd mention it. Visually the game is great and I say that as someone who isn't a big fan of pixel/retro style graphics but in Slain's case they worked and were executed well. To go with the smart visuals we also have a solid metal soundtrack which is a core part of the game and theme, so it was crucial that it was good and it is.\r\n\r\nOverall I do recommend the game but only if you enjoy challenging games, if you go into Slain expecting to He-man your way through everything you'll be sorely disappointed, you never feel particularly powerful and you're always one wrong button press away from death so it's quite stressful, but if this sort of adrenaline rush is what you enjoy then I'm sure you'll have a blast with Slain: Back from Hell.""}, {'score': 10, 'text': ""This game was released too early so they could make it's funder's happy.

This game should have no relation to JA series.  It should be its own franchise (see JA: Back in Action).  None of the characters from JA or JA2 are in BE5, and you aren't even working for AIM.  NPC interactions are a joke, I stopped caring about the storyline pretty early in the game because talking to NPCs was not enjoyable (translation not very good, no emotion in the characters, not personable).  As for the storyline, I was disappointed as well.  There are 3 factions, each don't like each other.  If you do missions for one, you will lose your status with the other(s).  Although, it really doesn't matter who you take your missions from, because all of the missions are pretty much the same among the factions, with tiny changes.  Mostly deliver a package, then assassinate someone, then retake a city, etc.  All of that being said, the game does have some positives.  If you aren't concerned with storyline and want to go around blowing everything up, this can be the game for you.  The weapon selection is pretty good; you can even select different ammo types for your weapons (FMJ, JHP, etc).  The RPG even has anti personnel rounds and anti armor rounds, even though you won't need to knock out tanks or other vehicles.  There are many attachments for every weapon as well.  You can deck it out for night ops with night vision devices (NATO and WP equipment), or go with CQB setup like red dot sight, or for long range (sniper scopes, ACOG, etc).  You can carry almost every version of M16 series or AK series.  Grenades, trip wires, land mines, body armor, the works.  Combat is pretty neat as it is all in real time, although you can pause the action to make your moves.  Although not exactly realistic, it does give you a chance to make decisions for your mercs (which won't do anything without your involvement).  I think this option is imperative for any game where the characters can't do some basic things for themselves (like defend themselves).  I would have liked to see more squad tactics, such as being able to move in tactical formations such as wedge, line, column, file, etc.  You won't have too much trouble with the bad guys for the most part.  They aren't very good at tactics, although I have been snuck up on occasionally (always have someone guarding your 6).  They aren't afraid to use grenades, and they usually carry some hefty firepower.  You can enter some buildings and go to multistories, shooting out of windows or off rooftops, but be careful doing so.  Launching rockets from the roof can be dangerous, because the rocket usually hits the roof ledge and explodes on contact, killing anyone unlucky enough to be standing next to the shooter.  This also goes with shooting from the roof; your merc will continue to blast into the roof ledge, with none of the bullets going to the intended target.  But it is fun to lob grenades from the roof on unsuspecting bad guys.  After all of that, I like this game.  Not for the storyline or interactions (JA2 was so awesome with that), but for the chance to go around causing mayhem.  I know this is a good game because I find myself pulling it off the shelf and reinstalling it, just to play the combat.""}]"

The 10 ratings are by users with well... Only one review to their account. I don't use review sites outside of reference but because either devs or bots want to make this seem like a wrongfully hated game... I gotta do my part in giving it a 0. Realistically it's a 1. Read below as for why:\n\n\nThey spent all the budget on the cutscenes... No for real though the cutscenes resemble end of service ps3 era anime like graghics but when you play the **** boy! It lookslike a horrible GameCube tech demo. The game runs like ****, I'm talking 15-45ish frames with background objects going even worse. Play it on modern Gen hardware? It's more consistently 50 or so frames but that's not a complement. This is bad game engine optimization. Game looks like outdated no budget trash. On a very powerful system.... It should have zero lag. This is incompetence. Now allow me to lecture you the story... Drugs. No, no, I mean it has no narrative. No dialog other than balan ego stroking. There's literally nothing here man. It's a vacant story with bad cutscenes that look like they were pitched by a middleschooler. Npcs? Why are they HUGE? Why does everyone dance? Soundtrack is also incredibly mediocre it isn't great. Stop it. Npcs don't fade out they just pop out. Anytime you're close poof gone. Vanished. Now let's talk sound design... Not great. Hey, ho, whaho. That's the jump sounds. They get old... FAST. balan is literally Cappy but without any charm. He has horibble, as others put it copy and paste QTE sequences because yeah.... They're the same. Every. Single. Time. Trophies of balan... Look the exact same and they insist on showing you a big pop-up screen every time you get one. Why? Next let's talk about damage... You'll get hurt by moving objects that don't even crush or squeeze you or fall onto you. Yeah just touching them is enough to get an ouchie.\n\nThe big part... Power ups.\nI wanted to save this one for later, so you can hold like 3 to start the game... And that should tell you puzzles will be simple. Here's why... Some powers are simple as a jump. Spin jump. Yoshi jump. Bubble jump. Slam jump. Jump with electricity and can swim verrrrry sloooooow, dolphin can swim faster. Some powers can't even jump. It's Mario you jump on heads and they die. Bosses  3 hit kill. Bosses lack any depth whatsoever it's just hit a projectile and then they loop an animation and throw more stuff for you to throw back at them. Literally sonic the hedgehog had more depth than this. F*** it even bubsy had better bosses. Even Alex Kidd. Alright I'm gonna a make this blatant as possible the game fricken ****.\n\n\n\nThe endgame...\nChao gar... Sorry, I meant TiMs garden. You find droplets scattered across every level and mini game, you can throw them at color coded flower fields in the overworld hub.... Because you totally need colored flowers to drop colored droplets... And basically they glitch out like crazy and TiMs follow you around making weird mentally challenged Pok??mon like noises. Why do they follow you? Who knows. But theydo automated tasks and it makes a ticker go up and at different numbers you unlock more stuff for your TiMs to like play or whatever...

The best part for me is the addictive gameplay. Each level has many save points, between the save points feels like a mini-level that you will probably die in the first time. You respawn quickly and with your knowledge of the traps and enemies you try again, maybe with a different approach, maybe you die again but now you might have a different idea for how to approach it the next play through. This is fun in a Hotline Miami or Super Meat Boy way, but may be it is hard to explain if you've never played those games. It might sound frustrating, and it can be, but it is also fun, engaging and extremely satisfying when you nail those difficult sections. You get into such a groove that you want to keep playing and playing. Most games are pretty easy, or easy enough to where you might have some challenge but rarely die, and that can get boring. This is not one of those games. It is an old school challenge that keeps you on edge, but with modern game mechanics such as frequent saves, unlimited lives, and quick respawn. The combat stays interesting due to the parry mechanic (which you have to master to survive) and elemental weapons you unlock throughout (such as a fire sword for ice enemies, ice axe for fire enemies and witches, etc). I played the game twice through back to back. It is fairly lengthy, but I wish there was something more to do after completing the main game.

Marines flank, suppress, and retreat with surprising intelligence, forcing players to strategize rather than simply rely on reflex. The alien creatures, from headcrabs to vortigaunts to the terrifying gargantua, each bring their own unique threat. Combat is fast, dynamic, and satisfying, and the variety of enemies ensures the gameplay never feels **** weapon arsenal is another highlight. From the iconic crowbar to the experimental Tau Cannon and Gluon Gun, almost every weapon feels iconic and distinct. Valve managed to create tools that not only fit within the world of Black Mesa, but also deliver some of the most memorable gunplay of the era. Each shot carries weight, and the game avoids the pitfall of padding its arsenal with useless or redundant weapons.Then there?€?s Xenthe final chapters that have long divided fans. While less visually detailed than the rest of the game, Xen deserves recognition for its ambition. It offers strange geometry, bizarre physics, and environments that truly feel alien. More importantly, it breaks the monotony of another lab corridor and gives narrative meaning to the invasion, culminating in a surreal, unsettling confrontation with the **** sound design, voice acting, and sparse yet impactful soundtrack elevate the overall experience even further. Every scream, explosion, and alien shriek contributes to the oppressive atmosphere. The minimal use of music allows each track to stand out, emphasizing tension or victory at crucial moments.What sets Half-Life apart is how well all these elements combine into a cohesive whole. There are no filler levels, no tonally inconsistent sequences, no unnecessary features weighing the game down. Everything is crafted with intention. Everything serves the experience. It is a game born of visionary design, technical innovation, and bold storytelling choices that the industry still builds upon **** me, Half-Life deserves a perfect 10/10not because it is flawless in a literal sense, but because it is flawless in its impact, ambition, and execution. It is a foundational masterpiece that every fan of the genre should experience at least once.""}, {'score': 9, 'text': 'Es el creador de una de la sagas m??s famosas del mundo de los videojuegos.

Well for one, in order to even RUN the game you have to move the cutscenes to another folder or delete them because the publisher and developer credits are bugged because the game is broken on today's system hardware.  Broken is the keyword. Because they ran out of money the game was shipped unfinished and is even more unfinished than something like Ride to Hell: Retribution. The amount of bugs in the game seems almost endless; in fact it's so buggy you'll die for no apparent reason. That is not a joke.\r\n\r\nThe story, voice acting, gunplay, level design, ect. is all horrendous. One could go over why each level is terrible in its own right, but there are three that stand out of the 22 levels. The 6th level has  you fight enemies within Airforce 1 (yes, THAT Airforce 1) until you activate an escape pod when doing so a timer starts, you have to get to the pod before time expires. Except, the game doesn't tell you there's a timer nor does it show you that there is one. The level after it is even worse. It takes place in the park in New York where you're supposed to find Dr. Lindstroem, who constantly goes from one place to another, leaving notes on his whereabouts, only to return to the spot where he was originally supposed to be, making the level a ridiculous and annoying chore, especially considering the fact that there is a lot of hostile cops. This level really shows how awful the movement is in the game, in fact bunny hopping is a more legitimate way to move. Also, there is a wall that does not properly extend to the ground which allows you to crawl in and fall to your death.\r\n\r\nI saved the best for last. The 21st level shows off one of two game breaking bugs. The minute you spawn into the level, you die. This is due to the fact that you're suppose to run away from rising water, but water rises too quickly and you immediately die. The second game breaking bug I mentioned will occur showing an error message 'OpenGL Error 436' and cause the game to close due to a manufacturing error with the game discs causing their material thickness to be altered, preventing the DVD drive from reading the discs properly. This caused StarForce, the DRM software that the game used, to incorrectly detect it as an illegitimate copy of the game and made it show the error message. Though it should be noted that StarForce itself is an extremely bad copyright-protection system.\r\n\r\n[link omitted per site rules] Psychotoxic is without question one of the worst games ever made, but despite all the problems, this game happened all because of the lead developer of the game Frank Fitzner, who had a dream to make a video game and despite how it turned out, made it happen. It's a shame we never saw a remake of this game nor a sequel to see what his vision truly was and we never will. Unfortunately, Frank Fitzner passed away in 2016.\r\n\r\nWe all at one point in our lives are told to go out and follow our dreams and Frank Fitzner did just that. I want that to be the main takeaway of this game and review. Just remember that if you ever doubt that you can accomplish your dreams remember that despite all the shortcomings Frank Fitzner did just that.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this...essay.

Additionally, tie him inextricably to the main character and thus please his eyes with three red putties? NO! This means that the Tyk in question may be interested in such a title. However, it was not the redhead who made Epistory appear in the third GraTyk. I mean, I know you don't believe my **** fact, I was tempted to buy the game during some promotion, where it was really cheap, by two things and one of them was the colorful world with an angular fox, and I will tell you about the second one. (I know you're sighing with relief that this won't be another eulogy for some furries.)Epistory is a game in which the entire world is discovered while traversing it, and it is - at least in the beginnings that I reached - actually colorful and captivating in its own way thanks to its interesting style. To navigate, we use the keyboard, or more precisely, the immortal wasd. (Was! D. As if a supporter of the left who couldn't bear the thought of turning to the right would say. SSSS as a stereotypical resident of Paris would say. Wad according to the Soviet concept, or finally esdf, i.e. Tyk, who constantly puts his fingers on the wrong keys and wonders why it pulls him to the right.) The considerations about naming have one, quite specific purpose. To hide the fact that walking is basically the same as in any other game and it is not worth devoting even a few moments to it. After all, the game was supposed to be unusual and worth attention, and this guy talks about the controls.However, the controls are what is so captivating about this game. Apart from the already mentioned walking, everything is done by writing. Literally everything, because even - after completing several stages - I discovered that it is possible to distribute points gained during the game by entering the name of a skill. Combat involves entering words, which are longer the higher the rank of the opponent. However, the weakest enemies require you to enter only one letter. The further you go, the more words to type becomes a bit overwhelming, but this is where the elements at the fox rider's disposal come to the rescue. I managed to unlock fire and ice and guess what? Switching between them also involves entering the appropriate words. Fire allows certain words to 'write' themselves by burning them out, while ice freezes enemies and prevents them from getting close. Because the enemies can't get to the fox rider unless they throw the girl down and start playing with the redhead. You die from the slightest contact, and of course you can't move while writing. So you have to write quickly! However, it is worth mentioning right away that these words have nothing to do with commands like in old RPGs, where in order for a character to say hello you had to write Hi. Here the words are only loosely related to what is happening on the screen. For example, spider webs are destroyed with words related to bugs, and fires are lit with words related to embers, heat and flames. This is indeed unusual and innovative, although it must be admitted that the game is not perfect. The optimization seems not entirely perfect to me. The plot conveyed by the inscriptions appearing on the ground is not always easy to read, and more importantly, it is not gripping. On the other hand, it is not the beauty of this small game, but the interesting concept, which includes an unusual control concept. And although it is not addictive for a long time, it is not a title that can take away long evenings from your life, it is a pleasant game that is nice to come back to to push the plot forward at least a little. Although definitely not worth the 14 euros it costs on Steam.""}, {'score': 4, 'text': ""I loved the idea of this.. an adventure typing game to help my son learn the keyboard.
